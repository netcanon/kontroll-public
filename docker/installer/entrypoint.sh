# The image + this dispatcher are the entire Phase-1 install glue; the provisioning IS
# ansible/playbooks/{bootstrap,local-canonical,deploy-stack}.yml + scripts/. Run via docker/services/installer.yaml:
#
#   docker compose run --rm init fresh-init --mgmt-ip <ip> --domain <domain>   # scaffold instance/ + mint control key
#   docker compose run --rm init check                                         # the mandated --check --diff dry-run
#   docker compose run --rm init                                               # bootstrap → deploy-stack (verb 'init')
#   docker compose run --rm init configure-semaphore                           # wire a running Semaphore (:3001)
