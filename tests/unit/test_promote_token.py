"""promote.plan_token / verify_token — the capability-neutral propose-then-promote anti-drift gate.

These pin the contract every secondary-capability dialog leans on (docs/observability/secondary-capability-
dialog.md §3.1): a promote may only land the EXACT plan the operator was shown. They guard that the token is
PURE (so the propose-time and promote-time hashes match), that part BOUNDARIES are part of the identity (so a
regrouped write-set can't masquerade as the original), that any drift flips verification to False (the 409
case), and that a malformed/absent token is a clean mismatch rather than a crash. The gate is consistency,
not authorization — so there is deliberately no secret/salt/clock to test.
