"""service/keygen.py — guided age key-generation (the second D headline, the most security-critical surface).
The crown-jewel properties are asserted as DATA: the generated PRIVATE key appears ONLY in the apply result's
`private_key` field (never in the .sops.yaml written, never returned by the plan); the .sops.yaml edit is
strictly ADDITIVE (no existing recipient is ever dropped) and idempotent; a scoped role lands ONLY in its
anchor group; and any keygen/verify failure writes NOTHING.

Why each guards a real failure: a leaked private key is the total compromise this feature must never cause; a
DROPPED recipient would make every secret unrecoverable (or a SMUGGLED one would over-expose them) — so the
parse-verify additive gate is the load-bearing safety net; a non-idempotent edit would churn the canonical on
every re-run. No real `age-keygen`/`sops` runs — the keygen shell-out seam is mocked.
