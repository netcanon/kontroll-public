"""paths.write_root() — the Phase-B WRITE-root seam (docs/reviews/2026-06-29-phase-b-baked-code/99-synthesis.md §6).

WHY (the failure these guard): Phase B bakes the immutable code + data registries into the published control image
at a read-only ROOT (`/opt/kontroll`) and points every WRITE at a thin propose clone (`KONTROLL_WRITE_ROOT=/propose`).
Splitting the read-root (ROOT, registries via the import-bound `*_DIR` constants) from the write-root (the clone,
every mutator + git op) is the single highest-C10 mechanism of the bake (review 30 §2): if a mutator follows ROOT
into the baked READ-ONLY image it either crashes on the read-only layer or silently writes a container-writable
overlay that is never pushed — a LOST proposal the GUI reports as "staged" (a correctness AND a C10 trust failure).

These pins assert the seam, with `KONTROLL_WRITE_ROOT==ROOT` as the byte-for-byte identity (review 30 §6.1):
  1. write_root() defaults to ROOT (the zero-behaviour-change identity for the CLI/tests/legacy `/repo` deploy) AND
     follows a repointed `paths.ROOT` (so the tmp_repo fixture + the ~25 ROOT-monkeypatching unit tests still divert);
  2. `KONTROLL_WRITE_ROOT` overrides ROOT (the baked deploy points writes at the clone, never the read-only image);
  3. the instance-overlay seam (resolve/overlay_target/overlay_rel) resolves against write_root while a read-only
     data-registry read (`os.path.join(paths.ROOT, "vectors", …)`) stays on ROOT — the two seams are NON-OVERLAPPING
     (review 30 §2.3). NOTE: `modules/` is the ONE registry that grows with operator action, so post-Rung-2 it is a
     two-root overlay via paths.module_file()/module_keys() (Fork B) — covered by test_module_overlay.py, not here;
  4. a mutator (gitio._write_new) with WRITE_ROOT set writes under the clone, leaving the baked ROOT UNTOUCHED
     (review 30 §6.3 at the unit level — the armed write lands in /propose, the baked image is unmodified).
