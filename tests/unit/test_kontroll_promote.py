"""kontroll-promote.py — the FIX-M9 pin-conflict gate before the fast-forward promote.

WHY (the failures these guard):
  * Two app-store units each pinning the SAME collection to a DIFFERENT exact `==` version both becoming `active`
    makes `gen-requirements` fail closed at GENERATE time — which halts the NEXT deploy's pre-image-build, a brick
    one seam removed from the cause. The promote gate must REFUSE such a promote (and NEVER advance `main`), so two
    conflicting `==` units can never co-exist. A clean proposal must still promote, and the gate must fail OPEN on
    its own read error (it hardens; it must never itself block a clean promote).
  * The detector is THIS tree's `gen-requirements.py --conflict-check --root <extract>` run over the extracted
    prospective tree as DATA — never the proposal's own copy of the script (2026-10-08 review, finding 3: that
    executed unreviewed code as root / with SOPS_AGE_KEY in scope). The wiring (archive → extract → trusted run →
    refuse on non-zero) is exercised end-to-end against real git + subprocess, not only a mock (the L2b lesson: a
    mock hides the plumbing bug), and the trust property is falsified with a proposal whose generator is a canary.
