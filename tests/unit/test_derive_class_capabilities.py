"""F2 (de-bespoke): a blind-onboarded device's metrics:/logs: FLOOR is AUTO-DERIVED from the conferred + universal
methods, not hand-typed — so an arbitrary device reaches the SAME universal monitoring/logging the ~7 curated
classes get, with zero curation, OR honestly documents the gap.

WHY (the failure these guard — docs/reviews/2026-06-29-north-star-onboard/20-debespoke-classes.md): a galaxy-onboarded
class mapped to a generic backend role with EMPTY metrics:/logs: — a blank Grafana, no Loki stream. The derivation
reads each backend's `confers.telemetry`/`confers.logs` (the ONE host->capability dispatch seam) + each method's
`derive_default` switch + applies_when, and emits the agent-less floor (snmp/blackbox metrics, syslog logs). The
crown-jewel properties asserted here: the floor NEVER fakes a vendor exporter it has no signal for (fail-honest), is
creds-free by construction (MF-S5), and reproduces the curated cisco_ios class BYTE-FOR-BYTE (the frozen oracle).
