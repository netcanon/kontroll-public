"""scripts/kontroll-init.py — the from-scratch bootstrap CLI (the keygen split's local half). Tests the pure
helpers (which login secrets it generates, parsing the age public key) and that `main` never prints the control
PRIVATE key and is idempotent on a configured node. The heavy lifting (the .sops.yaml recipient write, the
dashboards encrypt) is the already-tested keygen.add_recipient + secrets service — here we mock those seams and
assert kontroll-init's ORCHESTRATION + the no-leak property.

Why each guards a real failure: generating a login password for a field that's ALREADY set would silently
clobber the operator's password; printing the control private key would defeat the whole encryption-at-rest
model; a non-idempotent init would churn secrets on every re-run.
