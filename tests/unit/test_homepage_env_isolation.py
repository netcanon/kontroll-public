"""Homepage receives ONLY its own env — never the stack-wide docker/.env (2026-10-08 review, finding 5).

WHY: `homepage.yaml` used `env_file: ../.env`, the file deploy-stack renders with EVERY stack secret — the Semaphore
DB password and access-key encryption secret (which decrypts the store holding the runner's age key), the Grafana
admin password, the GUI password, the API token, every exporter credential. Homepage is the documented
UNAUTHENTICATED, all-interfaces portal (SECURITY.md C3); a Homepage RCE, or anyone who can read the container's
environment, got the whole stack for a tile board that needs a handful of widget tokens at most.

The fix: deploy-stack renders `docker/.env.homepage` with exactly the `homepage_var_*` keys of the `dashboards` SOPS
domain, and the fragment reads that file alone. These pins keep the two halves honest and make sure no OTHER fragment
quietly starts `env_file`ing the stack env (the pattern reads naturally, which is how it got in).
