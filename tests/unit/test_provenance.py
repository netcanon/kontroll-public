"""provenance domain — the read-only fleet install-PROVENANCE view (MF-5: no verification theatre).

WHY (the failures these guard):
  * On the 0-signature fleet EVERY collection must classify `unsigned-pinned` (amber) — verified by pin + checksum
    ONLY — so a green "installed" never implies a signature was checked. A collection is `signed` (green) ONLY when
    its policy is `required` AND a keyring is actually held (the one path where a served signature is verify-or-fail).
  * `digest_recorded` must reflect the L2b TOFU lock; the read must degrade to `available:false` when the trust
    sidecar isn't generated yet (a fresh tree pre-bootstrap) — never raise (the in-process GUI must survive).
  * the read must NEVER gain a write/actuation path (read-only-by-construction; INVARIANT D*).
