"""backups — the read-only per-device backup INDEX / VIEW / DIFF viewer (#131, gap 1 / C14).

These pin service/backups.py: a PURE read of the secret-bearing captures git store served over the GUI. WHY this is
the riskiest surface in the GUI — it puts crown-jewel device configs (hashes, PSKs, SNMP communities) on an HTTP
wire — so the tests are the GATE's machine-checks, not nice-to-haves:

  * G1 (M1): the captures mount is `:ro`, asserted on the literal `:ro` SUFFIX (a bare source:target defaults to
    `:rw`; a "`:rw` absent" check would fail-OPEN silently).
  * G2 (M2): a bad rev/file is rejected BEFORE any `git show` (path-traversal + rev-injection closed; the
    allow-list-membership file guard is stronger than a regex).
  * G3 (M3+M4): the redaction registry masks the REAL lab vendor token SHAPES (Cisco/FortiGate/OPNsense/RouterOS),
    validated with real-shaped lines (synthetic secret payloads — never a real lab hash); redact-then-diff never
    leaks that *a* secret changed; redaction is defense-in-depth, NOT the boundary.
  * G4 (M5): no capture value reaches the audit log (asserted in tests/integration/test_gui_api.py).
  * read-only BY CONSTRUCTION: the AST pin + the argv git-verb pin forbid any write/actuation path.

A missing store degrades to {available:false} and NEVER raises / NEVER sys.exits the in-process worker.
