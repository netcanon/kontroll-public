"""backup — the BACKUP instance (#2) of the secondary-capability seam + its suggester pair.

The point of Phase 8 is the SEAM PROOF: backup registers as a pure drop-in and the UNCHANGED capability spine
(capability.propose/promote, promote.plan_token) dispatches to it identically to telemetry. These pin that —
plus the instance's own contract: suggest_backup/declared_backup read the backup vector + block; build_plan is
pure, ADD-idempotent, and fail-closed (a non-preset schedule, a non-backup-capable role, an already-declared
class each refuse); the plan_token gates the written mapping block; and the descriptor's wiring resolves to
real callables. The registry now carries [telemetry, backup] and the generic INVARIANT D* pins auto-cover
backup with no new test code (see tests/unit/test_invariant_d.py — parametrized over registered_capabilities).
