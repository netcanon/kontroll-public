"""service/fleet.list_services — the control-plane services read powering the GUI Index panel's services section
(#128). A PURE read of config/services.yml with each URL templated from KONTROLL_MGMT_IP/KONTROLL_DOMAIN.

WHY (the gap this fills): the Index needs the fixed control-plane set (onboard-GUI/Semaphore/Grafana/…) as
config-as-data so the operator jumps to each running service from 'what's running'. These pin the env-templating,
the graceful no-base degradation, the never-raise posture (the in-process GUI worker must survive a bad data
file), and the read-only-by-construction contract (the Index must never gain an actuation path).
