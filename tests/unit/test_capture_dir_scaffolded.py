"""A freshly scaffolded instance can actually run backup-configs.yml.

F-BACKUPDIR (2026-07-28 fleet-restore review). `config_backup_dir` is referenced fifteen times in
ansible/playbooks/backup-configs.yml — starting with the directory it writes captures into — and was defined
in exactly ONE place repo-wide: `instance/inventory/group_vars/all.yml`. But `instance.example/inventory/`
shipped only `hosts.yml`, so **every** box built by `kontroll-init --fresh` had it undefined and the nightly
config backup could never run there.

The defect was invisible for the worst possible reason: the workstation checkout HAS the file (the homelab
tine commits a real instance/ overlay), so it works everywhere a developer looks and fails only on a real
freshly-installed box — the same shape as the fresh-node dry-run bug found the same day. Both are cases where
the development environment carries state that a new install does not.

Why the default lives in instance.example rather than ansible/playbooks/group_vars/: playbook-adjacent
group_vars OUTRANK inventory group_vars for `all`, so defining it there would silently override whatever an
instance set — the opposite of an overridable default. That precedence is the load-bearing reason for the
file's location, so it is asserted here.
