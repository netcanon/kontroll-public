"""Shared AST-based read-only-by-construction pins (#133).

Instead of a brittle substring grep over source text — which trips on comments/strings and can't scope to a single
function — these parse a module's AST and assert a named function calls NO write/actuation verb (nor opens a file
for writing). Used by the read-only service reads (`fleet.list_services`, and the forthcoming `pending.*` /
`backups.*`) to guard, IN CI, against any of them silently gaining an actuation path — the INVARIANT D* / C10
read-only contract. One robust seam, not three copy-pasted greps (M9 / review §2.3).

Leading-underscore module name ⇒ pytest does not collect it as a test; it is imported by the `test_*` files.

#134 / P0b — the COMPLETENESS closure. The per-function pins above fail OPEN: each checks a function's calls against
`WRITE_VERBS`, so a mutator the registry doesn't KNOW about is invisible — a read view could call an unregistered
writer and the pin would pass. `assert_write_verbs_complete` closes that hole: it AST-scans the pinned layer
(`scripts/kontroll/service/*.py` + `gitio.py`) for every DIRECT mutator (a write-mode `open`, a git-MUTATING argv,
a SOPS write) and asserts each is registered in `WRITE_VERBS` — so a new writer that isn't registered breaks CI,
making "add the verb in the same commit" an ENFORCED gate, not a convention. `assert_write_verbs_resolve` is the
no-rot complement (every entry is a real `def` or a bare git verb). The 2026-06-24 sweep that introduced this found
seven real gaps — incl. `sops_write_domain` (an UNPINNED secret-writer) — and registered them. (Tested in
`test_readonly_completeness.py`, incl. proof the gate fires on a planted unregistered writer.)
