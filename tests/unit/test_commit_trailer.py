"""The ONE configurable attribution trailer on machine-made commits (gitio.commit_trailer / commit_message_args).

WHY — until the 2026-10-08 public-split review (F9) eighteen call sites in the API, the GUI and galaxy.py each
carried a literal `Co-Authored-By: <the model that wrote the code>` trailer, stamped into every commit the control
plane makes on an OPERATOR's behalf: wrong attribution, eighteen places to edit, and a model name baked into a
public tool's runtime output. The fix is one seam — every commit path builds its `-m` list through
`gitio.commit_message_args`, which appends the trailer from `KONTROLL_COMMIT_TRAILER` (default: the tool's own
identity; `none`/`off`/`disabled` turn it off). These tests pin the seam's contract AND two gates that keep the
seam the only way to commit: no attribution literal may come back into a call site, and no `["git", "commit"]`
argv outside gitio may bypass `commit_message_args` (a raw `-m` list is how the literals got there to begin with).
