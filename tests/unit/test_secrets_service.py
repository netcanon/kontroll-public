"""service/secrets.py — guided secret-onboarding (the D headline). The security-critical properties are
asserted as data: secret VALUES never appear in the client-safe `view` or the apply result (only field NAMES
+ source); a required field with no value/generator/existing is a clean error; `generate:` mints on the box;
apply re-encrypts the WHOLE domain via the gitio sops seam (mocked — no real sops/age) and is idempotent.

Why each guards a real failure: a secret leaking into a response/log is the crown-jewel break this feature
exists to prevent; a silent missing-required would write a half-configured domain; a non-idempotent apply
would churn the canonical (a redundant proposal) on every re-save.
