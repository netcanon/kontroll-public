"""The actuation unit PREVIEW (R4): build_actuation_plan renders what a configured unit WOULD run, write-free.

WHY (the failures these guard):
  * the Review stage must show the operator EXACTLY what will run before anything is staged (design 24 §5) — a
    role unit's wrapper play (hosts:+roles:), or a collection-playbook/standalone run-spec, each with the derived
    access-chain header carrying the blast radius. A wrong/empty render would let an operator authorize a stage
    blind.
  * build_actuation_plan must FAIL CLOSED on bad input: an absent unit → no_unit (404), values that don't
    validate → invalid (422) — it must never render a play from un-validated values.
  * the preview is a READ: it must never gain a write/stage path (the read-only-by-construction contract; the
    staged write is R5). The AST pin asserts the whole module renders + reads only.
  * the enact hand-off must sequence the --check Dry Run BEFORE the apply (CLAUDE.md --check-first hard rule).
