"""INVARIANT D* — no secondary capability gates onboarding (docs/observability/secondary-capability-dialog.md §5).

The seam's load-bearing safety property: a device must be fully Ansible-usable after onboarding ALONE, with no
secondary capability (telemetry, backup, future) able to gate, block, or even influence it. These are the pins.
The PRIMARY pin is a positive allow-list that survives an EMPTY or broken registry (it cannot silently vanish
if the registry fails to load). The SECONDARY pins are registry-PARAMETRIZED — they grow as capabilities are
added, with a min-count guard so an empty parametrization is RED, never a vacuous green. Together they guard:
onboarding writes only its own known keys (never a capability block), it survives a suggester that raises, and
a suggester never mutates the repo.
