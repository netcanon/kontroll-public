"""fleet — the read-only onboarded-fleet view (#121).

These pin the service that powers the GUI Fleet panel: `list_fleet()` is a PURE read of instance/fleet.yml +
modules/<key>/module.yml + instance/inventory/* that groups inventory hosts under their device-class and surfaces
which secondary capabilities (telemetry/backup/logging) each class declares — so the operator can SEE what's
onboarded and the panel's per-class badges open the SAME capability dialog the search cards do. WHY (the gap this
fills): before #121 the GUI was search→onboard + dialogs only, with no page listing onboarded devices.
