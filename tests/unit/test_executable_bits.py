"""Tracked executable bits: a file that starts with a shebang is tracked 100755, and nothing else is.

WHY — the public-repository cut (2026-10-08) was produced by `git archive | tar -x` on a Windows host, which
dropped the executable bit on every entry point: `./bootstrap.sh` (docs/SETUP.md's first command), `scripts/kontroll.sh`
(the CLI), the installer entrypoint and the bundle/launch-kit scripts all landed as 100644, so a Linux clone of the
public tree failed its own quick-start with "Permission denied" while every CI gate stayed green (CI invokes them via
`bash`/`python3`). The private tree was inconsistent too — 11 of 48 shebang'd files were executable. The rule this pins
is the POSIX one and needs no list to maintain: outside docs/ (prose + dossier data), a tracked file is mode 100755
IFF its first two bytes are `#!`. Reads the INDEX mode (`git ls-files -s`), which is what a commit carries and is
authoritative on a Windows checkout with core.filemode=false.
