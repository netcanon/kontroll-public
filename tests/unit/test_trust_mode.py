"""F3 (trust_mode, Rung A): the OPTIONAL two-tine trust fork's FLAG slice — chosen at fresh-init, validated at
deploy, surfaced read-only in Settings. NO auto-promoter yet (that is a later, gated rung; the GUI/API trust
boundary is UNTOUCHED in both modes).

WHY (the failures these guard): a trust posture is the one setting kontroll must never silently default (unlike
tls_mode, which fail-SAFEs to self_signed) — guessing "human-reviewed vs auto promote" is never safe. These pin the
"never a silent default" property at its THREE defences (birth/template/deploy — the init-side birth pin lives in
test_kontroll_init.py), the read-only Settings surfacing, and that no auto-promoter / promote write was introduced
(the whole point of Rung A: posture is explicit + auditable, residual is zero).
