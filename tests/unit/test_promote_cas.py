"""promote_ref is a compare-and-swap, not a check-then-set (2026-10-08 review, finding 9).

WHY: the trusted promote ran `merge-base --is-ancestor main proposed/X` and then `update-ref refs/heads/main
proposed/X` with no old-value operand. Between the two commands another promote (the Semaphore approval task and a
CLI run, or two CLI runs) can advance `main`; the second `update-ref` then overwrites it with a ref that is no longer
a fast-forward of the `main` it replaces — the first promote is LOST, silently, while both report success. `git
update-ref <ref> <new> <old>` refuses when the ref is not at <old> ("is at X but expected Y"); that is the atomic
form. These tests run REAL git in a temporary bare repository: a mocked `_run` cannot prove the operand order git
actually accepts, and the race is injected at the only place it can happen — between the check and the write.
