"""Phase-1 proof obligations for the compose-native installer (docs/reviews/2026-06-29-compose-native-install/).

WHY — the installer relocates the install COMPUTE into an ephemeral container that bind-mounts the host's crown
jewels and drives the host docker socket. That is host-root-equivalent for the run's duration, so the security
floor (synthesis §5) is load-bearing and must be pinned in CI, not just reviewed once: no secret may ever reach an
image layer or a named volume; the installer must stay ephemeral + portless; the age key is referenced by FILE
(SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE) never the literal value; no Dockerfile mints a key at build (MF-3); the operator-identity
parameterization (MF-1) and the host-task in-container guards (MF-6) must be present so a non-root operator's
`compose up` works and an in-container run doesn't crash on host-only tasks. Each test names the failure it guards.
