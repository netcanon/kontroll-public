"""Propose-then-promote staging (SECURITY.md C10) — gitio._push_target / commit_and_push / promote_ref.

Pins the network-service write posture decided in docs/privileged-mutation-enablement.md: a service deployed
with KONTROLL_STAGE_PUSHES pushes a per-request `proposed/<run_id>` STAGING ref (never `main`), and
`promote_ref` fast-forwards `main` into a proposal ONLY when it is a strict fast-forward. Guards the two safety
properties — a staging service cannot write `main` directly, and a promotion cannot rewrite history — through
the `gitio._run` seam, offline. These are the covering checks C10's control claims (SECURITY.md).
