"""Fresh-install (Debian 12) compatibility guards for the from-scratch flow (docs/SETUP.md).

WHY — a live dogfood of the documented install on a clean Debian 12 (bookworm) control node hit four ansible /
collection version breaks, each blocking deploy-stack or configure-semaphore. This file pins the two that live in
static script/config; the other two are guarded where their logic lives (test_install_collections.py
::version_satisfied — the dist-packages floor shadow; test_configure_semaphore.py::admin_password — the sops
self-decrypt):

- deploy-stack.yml uses `ansible.builtin.deb822_repository` (added in ansible-core 2.15), but Debian's apt `ansible`
  metapackage is core 2.14 → "couldn't resolve module/action". So install-prereqs.sh must install ansible-core
  (>=2.16) via pip and NOT apt the `ansible` metapackage (which ALSO preseeds stale community.* collections into
  dist-packages that shadow the project lockfile pins).
- ansible.cfg's old `stdout_callback = yaml` was the `community.general.yaml` alias, REMOVED in community.general
  12.0 → every ansible run aborts "community.general.yaml has been removed". The built-in `default` callback +
  `result_format = yaml` is the version-proof equivalent.
