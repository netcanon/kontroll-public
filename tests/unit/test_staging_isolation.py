"""Staging isolation — the content clone rolls back to canonical main after each stage (F1, dogfood 2026-06-20).

These pin gitio.commit_and_push's STAGING behaviour: after pushing a `proposed/<run_id>` proposal it returns the
content clone's working tree to the canonical `main` (`_reset_content_clone_to_canonical`). WHY (the bug they
guard, live-caught on a real deploy): commit_and_push commits each staged reconfigure on the clone's LOCAL `main`,
advancing it; without the reset the clone drifts forward with every stage, so a fresh `build_plan` reads the
drifted tree — proposals STACK (B's ref = `main + A + B`), a REJECTED edit keeps contaminating later diffs, and —
because promote is FF-only — promoting B silently also enacts the abandoned A. The unit suite uses a fresh tmp
repo per test (monkeypatched `paths.ROOT`), so it could never see this cross-REQUEST accumulation; the second test
here drives TWO stages through ONE persistent real clone, exactly the shape that exposed it. The operator CLI
(target == `main`) must NEVER be reset — covered by the seam test. C10 / docs/privileged-mutation-enablement.md.
