"""homepage — the read+stage "arrange the portal" service for the GUI Homepage editor (#136, Phase 2).

These pin service/homepage.py: read_board() parses the two overlay files into a normalized board; the LINE-SPAN
serializer re-emits the board comment- and fleet-marker-preserving (never yaml.safe_dump); build_homepage_plan
diffs + tokens it; promote_board token-gates the write. WHY (the gap this fills): gethomepage only READS YAML, so
a GUI-configurable portal means the :8443 GUI rewrites the overlay — and a rewrite that dropped the operator's
comments or corrupted the file would be a config-eating bug. The round-trip-IDENTITY test is the load-bearing
safety net: an unchanged board must re-emit byte-for-byte. They also pin the security invariants: the serializer
can only relocate/omit existing spans (never synthesize a tile — C11), and read_board is read-only-by-construction.
