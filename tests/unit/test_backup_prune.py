"""backup-configs.yml: the #125 retention-prune play must be GATED, FAIL-CLOSED, and --check-safe — and the
truncation primitive must drop only commits older than the cutoff while preserving the latest snapshot.

WHY (the failures these guard): #123 declared + carried a `retention` window but NOTHING enforced it — a 30d
window was a lie. #125 adds a DESTRUCTIVE git history rewrite of the local-only captures repo. Three regressions
would be catastrophic or silent: (a) the prune runs when it shouldn't — keep-all/undefined MUST be a 0-changed
no-op, else every operator who never set a window silently loses history; (b) the prune runs on the WRONG repo —
without the fail-closed guard (no remote / not bare / not the canonical / real worktree) a refactor could point it
at /srv/kontroll.git and rewrite the source of truth; (c) the prune actuates under --check — the CLAUDE.md
`--check --diff` dry-run must never rewrite history. The structural tests pin (a)/(b)/(c) + the ordering (prune
AFTER the snapshot-commit play, before the SSH-key cleanup). The behavioral tests RUN the exact prune shell
embedded in the playbook against a real tmp repo with back-dated commits and prove it drops only the pre-cutoff
commits, leaves the latest snapshot's TREE byte-identical + the working tree clean, and is idempotent — the tests
that prove the destructive op does the right thing (a wrong-direction truncation would pass every structural test
and still destroy data). Design: docs/reviews/2026-06-23-backup-history-prune/.
