"""snmp.yml is rendered whenever the exporter is deployed — with or without SNMP credentials.

`prometheus/exporters/snmp/snmp.yml` is a **file**-bind into snmp-exporter. The G9 rule is that a file-bind
source must exist before `compose up`, content or not: if it is missing, Docker auto-creates the source as a
`root:root` DIRECTORY and the container dies with *"not a directory: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a
file"*.

The render used to be gated `and (_snmp | length > 0)`. The reasoning was sound as far as it went — on a fresh
node the `snmp_observability` domain does not exist yet, and an exporter with no credentials has nothing to
scrape — but nothing gated the SERVICE. So a fresh box that listed `snmp-exporter` in `stack_services` skipped
the render and then hard-failed at `up` (live-caught 2026-07-28, on the first from-scratch floating-prod build).
Two decisions that disagreed: render-if-creds, deploy-always.

`deploy-stack` already solves this exact problem twice — the empty device-CA bundle and the empty
file_tail_ssh known_hosts are both written unconditionally so their binds resolve to a FILE. snmp.yml was the
one that was missed, so the fix is to match: always render, and let the template omit the credential block.

These evaluate the real template rather than string-matching it, because the property that matters is what the
rendered YAML actually contains in each case.

Note this file is NOT covered by `tests/check-storage-chown.py`: that guard deliberately excludes relative
repo-tree binds (`../`) and only sees storage-root-derived sources. Repo-tree file binds have no general guard —
which is why this one needed its own.
