"""F1 seam S1 (Rung 1) — onboarding a PVE node through the CURATED proxmox class derives its coherent multi-field
api-token auth_set and stores the token FLAT under the domain field names the pve-exporter reads, so telemetry is fed
and Grafana populates (the empty-Grafana dogfood symptom closed end-to-end).

WHY (the failures these guard): pre-Rung-1 a proxmox onboard showed the generic single api_token box and stored the
value HOST-keyed (<host>_api_token) — but the pve-exporter reads flat proxmox_api_user/_token_id/_token_secret from
the proxmox SOPS domain, so it found nothing → empty Grafana. These pin: the reuse path derives the 3-field auth_set
(not the union); the SHARED creds land FLAT (not host-keyed) under the exporter's exact names; a half-filled required
set is refused (coherence — you can't half-authenticate); and a values-free dry-run still plans (INVARIANT D*: a
read/preview never gates onboarding).
