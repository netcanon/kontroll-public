"""scripts/gen-observability.py — Prometheus scrape targets GENERATED from the device modules + inventory.

This is the metrics analogue of gen-requirements.py: a device class declares its observability shape ONCE
as data (modules/<key>/module.yml `metrics:`), and the generator fans it out over the inventory hosts in
the class's group — so adding a device/host changes a scrape target with ZERO hand-editing of target files
(the 'generated, never hand-maintained' doctrine extended from collections to metrics). These tests pin
the join (modules x inventory -> targets), both scrape shapes (`via: host` and `via: proxy`), the honest
'no metrics block => no target' behaviour, and the --check staleness guard that keeps the committed
*.generated.yml in sync. The script name is hyphenated, so it is loaded by path (not importable).
