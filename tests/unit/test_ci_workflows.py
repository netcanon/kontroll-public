"""Text pins on the CI workflows the public split changed (publish target, the zizmor SARIF seat, Dependabot
strategy, third-party action pins).

WHY — a workflow file has no unit test of its own, so a behaviour the 2026-10-09 review fixed can quietly come back
in a later edit: the publish target hard-coded to one org again, the SARIF seat scanning `.github/` (every alert URI
wrong), an `|| true` hiding a real zizmor failure, a `security-events: write` grant minted on every run, a pip
ecosystem that chases `>=` floors, or a third-party action tag-pinned in the one job that can push to the package
namespace. Each test names the failure it guards and reads the committed YAML as text (plus a YAML parse where the
shape matters). CLAUDE.md: the test lands with the behaviour change.
