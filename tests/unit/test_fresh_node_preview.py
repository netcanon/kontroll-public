"""A `--check --diff` dry-run works on a brand-new node — without hiding anything that is genuinely wrong.

`--check` skips the tasks that CREATE things. On a node where nothing has ever been applied, the tasks that
then clone from the canonical, or take ownership of a TLS cert, have nothing to act on and fail:

    fatal: '/srv/kontroll.git' does not appear to be a git repository
    fatal: file (/var/lib/kontroll/api/tls/api.key) is absent, cannot continue

So the mandated dry-run could not pass on a fresh node — and `install-prereqs` prints `check` as step 3, before
the first apply (live-caught 2026-07-28 standing up the floating-prod box). That is worse than an
inconvenience: CLAUDE.md mandates `--check --diff` before any state-changing apply, and an operator who learns
the dry-run always fails the first time is one who will skip it when it counts.

The fix is one narrow fact, `_fresh_preview` = check mode AND no canonical yet, gating the handful of tasks
whose inputs provably cannot exist. Two properties make it safe, and both are pinned here:

  * It is NARROW. On an already-provisioned box it is false, so the dry-run keeps FULL fidelity exactly where
    fidelity is worth something — previewing a change against a system that already holds state.
  * It does not silence REAL preconditions. The G9 age-key gate still fails a fresh-node preview, because the
    operator genuinely must provision that key, and telling them before they apply is the dry-run doing its
    job. "Make check exit 0" was never the goal; "make check tell the truth usefully" was.
