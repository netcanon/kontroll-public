"""The REST/API liveness check can actually fail, and says something useful when it does.

Three defects found by the 2026-07-28 fleet-restore review
(docs/reviews/2026-07-28-fleet-secret-restore/), all in the path aimed at the **edge firewall** — the
highest-blast-radius device in the fleet:

  F-CANTFAIL  roles/backend_api/tasks/check.yml registered `_api_check` with `failed_when: false` and then
              never read it again; the file ended one line later. A 200, a 401, a 403 and a refused
              connection were indistinguishable, so the check COULD NOT FAIL. It reported success against a
              device it had never authenticated to. A green check that means nothing is worse than no check,
              because a reclaim/cutover decision gets made on the strength of it.

  F-TOKENVAR  The recipe declares the var it reads (`token_var: fortios_api_token`) and
              ansible/backends/api/backend.yml claimed "the planner resolves it". Nothing ever did:
              service/onboard.py puts only `network_os` into `backend_params`, so `params.get("token_var")`
              is always None and an onboarded host gets `<host>_api_token` — a name the role never looked
              up. paths.py defines RECIPES_DIR and no Python reads it. The documented design was never
              implemented, so the check could not have authenticated even with a perfect credential.

  F-CENSORED  `lookup('vars', X)` raises AnsibleUndefinedVariable for a missing name, and the resolve task
              carries `no_log: true`, so that fatal arrived CENSORED. ping.yml's block/rescue turned it into
              a bare `hostname: UNREACHABLE` — a healthy firewall, reported down, with no way to tell that
              from a real outage.

Together these meant the edge-firewall check was incapable of either passing honestly or failing
informatively. These tests pin the fix and, just as importantly, pin that the fix did not print a secret to
get there: the response body is device configuration and the request carries the token.
