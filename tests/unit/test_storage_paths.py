"""Storage-location paradigm regression guards (the C8 at-rest contract for KONTROLL_STORAGE_ROOT + overrides).

Why each guards a real failure:
  * a storage bind source with no uid-scoped deploy-stack provisioner is the G9 hole — `docker compose up`
    auto-creates the missing host source as root:root 0755, world-readable secret-bearing logs (C8/C12). The
    guard (check-storage-chown.offending) is exercised here so a regression fails the pytest matrix AND the
    validate gate together (the dual-surface pattern of test_mgmt_parameterization.py);
  * a guard that has never been observed to FAIL is not a guard — so we inject a synthetic un-provisioned bind
    and assert it is flagged (the negative-path proof the review required), AND assert that removing the age.key
    fail-closed guard re-flags the age.key bind (the M-1 lock: an EXACT-own-path match, never a grandparent walk);
  * a bare ${VAR} bind source resolves EMPTY when unset → a `/`-rooted or empty-prefixed mount (fail-open);
  * deploy-stack and .env.example must agree on the storage root default, or a no-override deploy diverges from
    the documented behaviour (the render-path trap the mgmt test already guards for IP/domain).
