"""The C10 canonical group (gid 1001) must be PROVISIONED by the host floor, not left as a documented manual step.

WHY (the failure this guards — hit LIVE on the 2026-06-29 `.52` baked-prod dogfood, "F-CANON" / task_51334deb):
the canonical bare repo `/srv/kontroll.git` is group-gid-1001 (the uid:gid the privileged api/onboard-gui write
proposals as). The operator's `kontroll-promote` advances `main` and DELETES the consumed `proposed/<run_id>` ref —
which fails "Permission denied" unless the operator is a member of that group. `local-canonical.yml` provisions the
group + membership on a HOST-DIRECT run but SKIPS them inside the installer container (`when: not in_container`),
which is exactly how the published-kit (`kontroll.sh`) and local-build (`kontroll-installer.sh`) launchers run the
deploy. So a published-kit install left the group unprovisioned and every promote failed — the gesture was only
PRINTED as a manual `sudo groupadd … && sudo usermod …` step that the operator never ran.

The fix is the shared `scripts/lib/canonical-group.sh`: the root host-floor installer (`install-prereqs.sh`) CREATES
the group + adds the operator, and the operator launchers ENSURE-OR-WARN (auto-provision via sudo if available, else
print the exact one-liner loudly — never silently). This test pins (1) the helper defines all three verbs and names
gid 1001 + groupadd + usermod, (2) each of the three scripts sources the helper and calls the right verb, and (3) the
old PRINTED manual `groupadd -g 1001` step is GONE from the install prose — so a refactor that drops the gesture or
re-demotes it to a manual step (re-breaking a fresh published-kit install's first promote) fails loudly here.

A live shell run isn't unit-testable hermetically (the Windows dev box vs Linux CI differ on PATH separators and
whether `sudo` exists), so — as with `test_local_canonical.py` for the playbook — this asserts the wiring statically;
the behaviour is dogfood-verified on a real box. SECURITY.md C10.
