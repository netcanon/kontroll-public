"""The instance-overlay path resolver — kontroll.paths.resolve / overlay_rel.

This is the seam (genericization arc, Decision A) that lets a private, gitignored `instance/` overlay shadow the
shipped generic stubs for a deployment's real config (fleet, inventory, secrets, .sops.yaml). Every Python reader
of an instance path was repointed through it in Phase-2 step (i).

What these verify and why:
  1. With NO overlay file present, every mapped instance path resolves to its LEGACY in-tree location — the
     ZERO-BEHAVIOR-CHANGE invariant the step-(i) repoint depends on. A regression here would silently divert
     instance reads/writes to the wrong tree (or break the live deploy, which has no `instance/` dir yet).
  2. An overlay file, once present, is preferred PER FILE — a half-populated overlay (mid-migration) still falls
     back for the files it lacks, so a partial copy can never half-break the running instance.
  3. A path UNDER a mapped dir maps correctly (ansible/secrets/x -> instance/secrets/x), preserving the
     inventory<->secrets sibling layout the ansible `inventory_dir/../secrets` lookup + SOPS vars-plugin need
     (genericization-manifest.md §4, coupling 2).
  4. A non-instance (tool) path is NEVER rewritten, even when an overlay exists.
  5. overlay_target (the NEW-file WRITE seam) is DIR-active (not file-existence), so a not-yet-written file lands
     in an active overlay AND a write target always equals its git-add path (the C10 staging invariant — the
     silent "encrypt to overlay but stage the legacy path" regression the step-(ii) sweep surfaced).
