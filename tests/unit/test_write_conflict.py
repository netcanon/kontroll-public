"""A divergent drop-in must raise the CATCHABLE gitio.WriteConflict, never sys.exit.

WHY (the failure this guards): `_write_new` used `sys.exit(...)` to refuse clobbering a divergent file. In the
CLI that's fine, but the GUI/API call the onboard service IN-PROCESS — and `sys.exit` raises SystemExit, which
derives from BaseException, so Flask/Werkzeug does NOT catch it: it killed the onboard-gui request worker and the
browser saw a bare "request failed" with no message. Live-caught onboarding a device with key `cisco_ios` (a
SHIPPED module). The fix raises WriteConflict (a normal Exception) so the routes return a clean 409 and the CLI
exits cleanly. These pins keep it an Exception (not a worker-killer) and keep _write_new raising it.
