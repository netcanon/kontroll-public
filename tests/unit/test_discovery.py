"""discovery-inbox Rung 1a — the passive-discovery read spine (registry + sweep actor + pure read_inbox).

WHY these tests (the failures they guard): the whole feature's safety claim is "zero new authority + passive +
read-only", so each test pins one leg of that — the DECLARED offer actually reaches opnsense (a facts predicate
would reach nothing, F2), the fetcher exposes ONLY a GET (no scan/write primitive can creep in, C18), a hostile
device response is DATA not code (dropped/normalized, never an injection into the result), the IP-diff hides an
already-onboarded host, the flood cap bounds a malicious lease flood, and — the load-bearing one — `read_inbox`
stays `assert_read_only`-green so the read view can never gain a write/actuate path (the design-of-record's
out-of-band-cached-model proof). Design-of-record: docs/reviews/2026-07-03-discovery-inbox-scope/99-synthesis.md.
