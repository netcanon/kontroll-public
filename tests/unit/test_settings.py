"""settings — the read-only "what is my instance configured as?" view (#135, GUI-paradigm Phase 1).

These pin service/settings.read_view(): a PURE, value-free, four-group snapshot (identity / backup / fleet /
status) of the platform configuration powering the GUI Settings panel. WHY (the gap this fills): the GUI had no
"show me my instance" surface — mgmt_ip/domain/tls_mode, the enabled fleet, the offsite remotes, the arming
posture, and which secret domains are set were only visible by reading files on the box. They also pin the two
load-bearing properties: it serves NO secret value (C11 — the secret roster is NAMES + set/unset only), and it is
read-only-by-construction (the #133 AST pin) so a future edit can't slip a write into the status surface.
