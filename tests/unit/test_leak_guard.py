"""tests/_leak_guard.py — the identifier-leak guard behind every "no real topology / no personal identifier" gate.

WHY (the failures these guard, found by the 2026-10-08 public-split sweep):
- Capture-filename fixtures spelled a real lab address with DASHES (`cisco_ios_192-168-11-2.cfg`) and every earlier
  guard matched dotted IPs only, over a scope that did not include tests/. The structural layer must catch any
  separator form, over the whole shippable tree.
- The earlier guards EMBEDDED the very hostnames/domain they blocked (a public repo would publish its own denylist).
  The instance-token layer reads them from a private file instead; the canary file keeps the mechanism exercised
  on a checkout that has no private list, and the self-test here proves a scan that finds nothing is not a scan
  that ran nothing (a guard never observed to fail is not a guard).
- Python's `ipaddress.is_private` is true for the RFC-5737 documentation nets — the sanctioned example space — so a
  naive private-range check would flag every TEST-NET example; the RFC-1918 ranges are named explicitly.
- A failure report must never itself be the leak: a matched instance token is reported by index + digest only.
- (2026-10-09 review) The public cut ignored `instance/` outright, so an install made from the public tree committed
  NO overlay into the control node's canonical (`git add -A` skips ignored paths) and Semaphore silently read the
  example tier; the old "overlay never tracked" probe used `git check-ignore` without `--no-index`, which never
  reports a tracked path, so a `git add -f` passed it; and `docs/reviews/` was never scanned on any tree. The
  overlay invariant + the instance-only strip of docs/reviews/ fix all three; the scratch-repo tests below prove
  the shipped .gitignore rules with real git.
