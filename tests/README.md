# kontroll test suite

kontroll is a *composed* control plane, so it has two test halves:

- **The IaC half** — the test pyramid below (lint → syntax → live-smoke →
  idempotence), distilled from the NetConfig project's four-layer suite.
- **The code half** — a `pytest` suite over the real Python surfaces
  (`scripts/galaxy.py` + the `gui/` Flask app). See [Code-half pytest](#code-half-pytest).

Full rationale: [../docs/engineering-standards.md](../docs/engineering-standards.md) §1
and [../docs/qa-and-release-pipeline.md](../docs/qa-and-release-pipeline.md) §1. The binding
test-doc + data-testid + test-after-change discipline is
[../docs/testing-standards.md](../docs/testing-standards.md); the GUI selector inventory is
[testid_reference.md](testid_reference.md).

## The pyramid (IaC half)

| Layer | What | Tooling | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 lint** | YAML/Ansible/compose/Prometheus syntax + secret hygiene | `validate.ps1` / `validate.sh` | every commit (pre-commit + CI) |
| **L2 validate** | playbooks parse against a mock inventory; role logic in containers | `--syntax-check`, Molecule | on change, CI |
| **L2 pytest** | `galaxy.py` + GUI logic, shell-outs mocked (no lab) | `pytest` (`unit/` + `integration/`) | on change, CI |
| **L3 GUI e2e** | the GUI in a headless browser over the real booted app | Playwright (`tests/e2e/`, `e2e` marker) | a dedicated CI job |
| **L3 live smoke** | real fleet reachable; services respond | `playbooks/ping.yml`, post-deploy asserts | manual / Semaphore schedule |
| **L4 idempotence** | second apply = `0 changed` | re-run the role; Molecule `idempotence` | per role |

## Running

```powershell
# Windows workstation (runs whatever tools are installed; skips the rest)
pwsh tests/validate.ps1                 # Windows: a shim over validate.sh (Git for Windows' bash) — the same gate
```
```bash
# Linux control VM / CI (use --strict so missing tools fail the run)
bash tests/validate.sh --strict
```
```bash
# L2 dry-run a playbook against fake hosts (no real device touched)
ansible-playbook -i tests/mock-inventory.yml ../ansible/playbooks/backup-configs.yml --check --diff

# L2 containerized role test (when molecule is installed)
cd tests/molecule/default && molecule test
```

## Isolation (per layer)

| Layer | Isolation mechanism |
|---|---|
| L1 | none needed — pure static analysis of files |
| L2 | `mock-inventory.yml` with `ansible_connection: local` + RFC-5737 doc IPs — the single seam for real↔fake (our `FakeCollector`) |
| L3 | runs against the live fleet; read-only plays only unless gated |
| L4 | a throwaway Molecule container, destroyed after |

## The single mock seam

Mirroring NetConfig's rule ("patch `get_collector`, never `ConnectHandler`"):
tests never hard-code a real device. They target `tests/mock-inventory.yml`,
whose hosts dispatch through the same `device_role` seam as production. To swap
real ↔ fake you change the inventory, nothing else.

## Adding tests

1. **L1**: nothing to add — new YAML is linted automatically. Keep it valid.
2. **L2 syntax**: a new playbook is picked up by `validate` automatically.
3. **L2 pytest**: drop a `test_*.py` under `unit/` (pure logic) or `integration/`
   (a command driven as a black box). Mark it `@pytest.mark.unit`/`integration`.
4. **L2 Molecule**: copy `molecule/default` to `molecule/<role>` and point it at
   the role; assert converge + idempotence.
5. **L3 smoke**: add a read-only assertion play (service responds / target `up`)
   under `ansible/playbooks/` and tag it `smoke`.

## Code-half pytest

`scripts/galaxy.py` (a thin CLI over the `scripts/kontroll/` **service package** — the pure
logic, probers, sources, and repo-mutators, one `service/<domain>.py` per verb), `gui/app.py`
(the Flask shell), and `api/` (the typed FastAPI over the same service layer) are real code, tested
with `pytest`. The suite is **fully offline** — it touches
no ansible, no network, and no lab — because the I/O seams are mocked **in their home modules**
(patch there, not on `galaxy`):

| Surface | I/O seam (the mock point) | What it shells to |
|---|---|---|
| deep probe | `kontroll.probe._ad`, `kontroll.probe.deep_probe` | `ansible-doc` |
| shallow local probe | `kontroll.probe.shallow_from_local`, `kontroll.catalog.local_shallow` | the installed collection's files (`plugins/` walk + `MANIFEST.json`) — no `ansible-doc` |
| local list | `kontroll.catalog.local_installed` | `ansible-galaxy collection list` |
| Galaxy search | `kontroll.catalog.galaxy_search` | `galaxy.ansible.com` (urllib) |
| repo mutation | `kontroll.gitio._run` | `git` / `sops` |
| `gui/app.py` onboard | service seams (`build_onboard_plan`/`apply_onboard_plan` + `kontroll.gitio._run`) | in-process, mirrors `api/routes/onboard.py` — search/classify/onboard are ALL in-process now (`run_galaxy` retired) |

The core (`eval_pred`/`eval_vector`/`classify`/`build_record`/`derive_*`/
`classify_endpoints`, now in `kontroll.predicate`/`record`/`service.openapi` and re-exported
off `galaxy` for call-style tests) is **pure dict→dict** and tested directly against the real
`vectors/*.yml` + `ansible/backends/*/backend.yml`. The file-mutating paths
(`enable_in_fleet`, onboard `--apply`) run against a throwaway repo (`tmp_repo`
repoints `kontroll.paths.ROOT`), so they never touch the real tree, and credentials are
omitted so the SOPS shell-out is never invoked.

  test_onboard_flow.py       # search → result card → fill form → dry-run → plan renders (Playwright)
```

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements-dev.txt          # tiny: pytest + pyyaml + flask
pytest -m "not e2e and not slow"                   # the hermetic default (CI runs this)
pytest --cov=scripts --cov=gui --cov-report=term-missing
```

`validate` runs this as its L2 step automatically when `pytest` is installed (it
skips gracefully on a box without it); CI runs it as a dedicated matrix job
(py3.11–3.13). `e2e`/`slow` are excluded from the default — the live lab and any
Playwright GUI flow are never in the hermetic gate.

## Identifier-leak gate (`tests/_leak_guard.py`)

`validate` step `pii-guard` (and the PII-guard workflow, and the pytest twin
`tests/unit/test_leak_guard.py`) scans every git-tracked file outside the private strip set
(`instance/`, `docs/reviews/`, `local/`) for anything that identifies a real deployment: an
RFC-1918 address in any spelling (dotted, dashed as capture filenames spell it, underscored),
a non-documentation MAC or global IPv6, a real-length age key, a personal e-mail or an
operator-machine path — plus the instance's own names from `instance/leak-tokens.txt` (never
shipped; the shipped `instance.example/leak-tokens.example.txt` holds canaries so the layer is
always exercised). Fixtures and docs use the documentation ranges — `192.0.2.x`,
`198.51.100.x`, `203.0.113.x`, `00:00:5e:00:53:xx`, `2001:db8::/32`, `example.com`. A test that
*must* hold a private address marks the line `pii-guard: allow <reason>`. SECURITY.md C21.

## Secret-hygiene gate

`validate` fails if any `instance/secrets/*.sops.yml` is not encrypted, or if a
key artifact (`keys.txt`, `*.agekey`, `*.dec`) is staged. This is the
config-as-code analog of NetConfig's `test_logging_config.py` credential
guarantee.

## Read-only-by-construction gate (`tests/unit/_readonly_pins.py`)

The shared AST pins guard the read-only / C10 two-key guarantee in CI: `assert_read_only`
(a named read function calls no write/actuation verb, #133) + `assert_no_git_write`
(a service that shells git picks a read-only subcommand on every argv, #131). Both check
calls against `WRITE_VERBS`, so they fail **OPEN** — a mutator the registry doesn't know
is invisible. `assert_write_verbs_complete` (P0b/#134) closes that: it scans the whole
service+gitio layer and fails CI if any **direct** mutator (write-open / git-mutating argv /
SOPS write) isn't in `WRITE_VERBS` — so registering a new write verb in the same commit is an
enforced gate, not a convention (`test_readonly_completeness.py`, proven against planted
violations). Add a new read view? Add its `assert_read_only` test. Add a new writer? CI tells
you to register it.
