"""scripts/make-bundle.sh — the release bundle must ship the TOOL ONLY, never this instance's private overlay.

Why this guards a real failure: the bundle is a PUBLIC distributable (GitHub Releases / file transfer). If it
carried the `instance/` overlay it would leak this instance's `.sops.yaml` recipients, encrypted secrets,
inventory IPs, fleet, and dashboards to every downloader — and a fresh operator would INHERIT the author's
recipients instead of scaffolding their own via `kontroll-init --fresh` (the blind-Joe footgun). The internal
`docs/reviews/**` snapshots likewise leak IPs/domains. The bundle must instead ship only the public
`instance.example/` stub + the product code. This builds the real bundle and pins that the strip held.
