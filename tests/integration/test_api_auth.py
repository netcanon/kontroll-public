"""The privileged API surface — Bearer-token auth + the run_id-correlated audit (ws3).

The security-critical contract (docs/api-architecture.md §4, §7): fail-closed when no token is
configured (503) and on a bad token (401, audited); a configured token admits the low-blast-radius
mutations (POST /refresh, POST /capture-exceptions) and they are AUDITED; the audit is itself
fail-closed (an un-auditable mutation is refused, not performed); the log is queryable. The git seam
and the matrix cache + capture-exception matrix are pointed at throwaway paths so nothing real is
touched and no lab is reached.
