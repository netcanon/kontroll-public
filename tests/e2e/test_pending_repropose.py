"""E2E — the Pending panel's 'Re-propose' button on a STALE proposal (FF-race remediation, Move 1).

WHY: when the base moves under a staged proposal (the auto-promoter promoted a later LOW-blast one), that proposal
becomes non-FF and its promote is silently REFUSED. Part 1 (#144) badges it 'stale'; this proves the follow-through
in a REAL browser — the stale row exposes a `pending-re-propose` button that NAVIGATES the operator back to the
proposal's device class (the class key is all a ref's path names yield), landing them on the SAME onboard dialog to
re-run it against current main. It is a navigation affordance, NOT an actuation: no promote/stage happens on click
(C10 two-key intact — the button only closes the panel, sets a context banner, and runs the class search). The
proposal list is mocked per-test with `page.route('**/api/pending', …)` (an isolated stale onboard proposal) so no
canonical repo / real staging is needed; the class card comes from the conftest shallow-search mock (cisco.ios).
