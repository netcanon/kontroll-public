"""Resolve the collection set (modules/_core.yml + each enabled module's module.yml,
driven by instance/fleet.yml) into an ansible-galaxy requirements file.

Standalone — no ansible (the one kontroll import, paths, is os-only: the instance-overlay
resolver) — so CI (and anyone) can install the collections without running the full bootstrap. Mirrors ansible/playbooks/bootstrap.yml's resolution
against the SAME source of truth (modules/); it is never a hand-maintained list (a hard
rule — see CLAUDE.md). Output path defaults to the generated lockfile bootstrap also uses.
