# Non-destructive code update for a REMOTELESS kontroll instance (no upstream git remote).
#
# scripts/update.sh is the git-connected update path (fetch origin -> merge -> re-seed). A
# production box in the local-as-truth posture (docs/local-source-of-truth.md) has NO GitHub
# remote, so it can't `fetch origin`; instead the developer ships a `git bundle` of the new
# PRODUCT code (built on a connected machine) and applies it here. Everything past the fetch is
# IDENTICAL to update.sh: a state-preserving `git merge` (code & state live in DISJOINT files —
# config/state-manifest.yml — so the merge is normally conflict-free; a real conflict means a
# *code* file was edited on this instance, surfaced never silently lost), then re-seed the local
# canonical the running instance (Semaphore) reads, so the new code takes effect with no remote
# git at run time. This codifies the #145 bundle-merge dance (previously hand-run).
#
# Build the bundle on a git-connected machine (thin — the box already has its current HEAD as basis):
#     git bundle create kontroll.bundle <box-HEAD-or-merge-base>..main      # or, full: git bundle create … --all
#     git bundle verify kontroll.bundle
# scp it to the box, then:
#     scripts/update-from-bundle.sh kontroll.bundle [<branch>]
#
# Usage:  scripts/update-from-bundle.sh <bundle-file> [<branch>]      # default branch: main
