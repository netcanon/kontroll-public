# Snapshots exactly the config/state-manifest.yml paths — the single boundary, so this
# can never drift from what "state" means. Contents mirror the repo: SOPS-ENCRYPTED
# secrets (safe to store) + inventory (holds lab IPs — keep the archive on trusted
# media). The age key is NOT included by design (it's the offline break-glass secret);
# a restore needs it separately, so a leaked snapshot alone can't decrypt anything.

# Usage:  scripts/state-snapshot.sh [<output-dir>]     # default: current dir
# Restore: scripts/state-restore.sh <snapshot.tar.gz>
