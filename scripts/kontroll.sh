# kontroll — the bundle-as-compose launcher (C1). The single host gesture a fresh control node uses when installing
# from PUBLISHED, digest-pinned images (the launch kit) instead of a local build. Host floor = Docker + git ONLY —
# no host python/ansible/sops/age (those live in the pulled installer image). This is the published-path sibling of
# scripts/kontroll-installer.sh (which BUILDS the image locally from the repo); the only difference is:
#   local-build:  docker compose … run --build  init      # builds docker/installer/Dockerfile
#   published:    docker compose … pull init ; run --no-build init   # KONTROLL_INSTALLER_IMAGE := the ghcr @sha256 digest
# Design-of-record: docs/reviews/2026-06-29-compose-native-install/22-distribution-images.md §6 (bundle-as-compose).
# scripts/make-launch-kit.sh copies this to the launch-kit ROOT as `kontroll` (it lives at scripts/kontroll.sh in the
# repo because scripts/kontroll/ is the Python service package — the name would collide).
#
# Usage (verbs mirror docker/installer/entrypoint.sh):
#   ./kontroll fresh-init --mgmt-ip <ip> --domain <domain>   # scaffold instance/ + mint the control age key
#   $EDITOR instance/fleet.yml instance/inventory/hosts.yml instance/instance.yml
#   ./kontroll check                                         # the mandated --check --diff dry-run
#   ./kontroll init                                          # bootstrap → deploy-stack (pulls runner/vector by digest)
#   ./kontroll configure-semaphore                          # wire a running Semaphore (:3001)
