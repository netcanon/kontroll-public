"""Validate that every DERIVED device class's pinned capability FLOOR still matches what the F2 derivation
recomputes — the no-bespoke `--check` teeth for the metrics:/logs: floor (the analogue of gen-observability
--check, but the "lockfile" is the module.yml's own `derived: true`-marked entries, not a separate file).

A class marked `derived: true` in modules/<key>/module.yml carries an AUTO-DERIVED metrics:/logs: floor
(classify.derive_class_capabilities) — the agent-less snmp/blackbox metrics + syslog logs a blind onboard gets
with zero curation. To keep that floor from rotting when the world churns (a method's `derive_default` changes, a
backend's confer list changes, a new universal method ships), this generator RE-DERIVES the floor from the class's
PINNED offline facts (modules/<key>/facts.pinned.yml) + the static registries and asserts the module's
`derived: true`-marked entries still MATCH. A drift fails CI, naming the exact class + capability.

OFFLINE + hermetic (BRICK-1): reads only the committed facts.pinned.yml + the registries; NEVER re-probes (that
needs the collection installed + is non-deterministic). The onboard path is the WRITER (it derives + pins a new
class's floor at onboard time); this is the CHECKER. Bare (operator-curated) metrics/logs entries — the vendor
override tail — are NOT checked; only `derived: true`-marked entries are owned here.

Standalone except for kontroll.catalog/paths/predicate + the classify derivation (no ansible); mirrors
gen-observability.py so CI + deploy-stack can run it.

Usage:  python3 scripts/gen-class-capabilities.py [--check]   # --check validates; bare prints the result
