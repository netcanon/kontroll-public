    WHY (the bug this closes, dogfood-caught 2026-06-29 on the .52 baked prod box): the clone commits each proposal
    on its LOCAL `main`, which `_reset_content_clone_to_canonical` last set to `local/main` AFTER the *previous*

    makes `proposed/B = seed+A+B'`, a clean FF — no manual `git fetch && reset --hard local/main` between promotes
    (the live workaround this replaces). On a GENUINE conflict (the proposal and the promoted change touch the same
