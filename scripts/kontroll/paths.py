"""Filesystem paths + shared constants for the kontroll service package.

`ROOT` is the repo-root READ seam: the derived directory constants (`MODULES_DIR`, …) are
bound once from the REAL tree at import, so loaders always read the real repo (read-only
input) even when a test has repointed ROOT for a mutator. `write_root()` is the WRITE seam:
where the file-mutating service functions write the instance-overlay propose tree + run git,
read DYNAMICALLY (so the tmp_repo test fixture's `paths.ROOT` repoint still diverts writes).

`write_root()` defaults to `ROOT` — so the CLI, the tests, and the legacy `/repo`-clone deploy
are byte-for-byte unchanged (WRITE_ROOT == ROOT is the identity). A Phase-B BAKED deploy sets
`KONTROLL_WRITE_ROOT=/propose` so the read-only image code tree at ROOT is never written: the
immutable code + data registries are read from the baked ROOT, while every write + git op
targets the thin propose clone (docs/reviews/2026-06-29-phase-b-baked-code/99-synthesis.md §0).
Lifted from the old galaxy.py module-level constants, now in one place every module imports.
