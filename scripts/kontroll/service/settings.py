"""settings domain — the read-only "what is my instance configured as?" view (#135, GUI-paradigm Phase 1).

`read_view()` assembles a value-free, four-group snapshot of the platform configuration for the GUI Settings
panel: **identity** (mgmt_ip / domain / tls_mode / source_of_truth from instance.yml), **backup** (the offsite
`backup_remotes` list), **fleet** (the `enabled_modules` from fleet.yml), and **status** (whether privileged
mutation is ARMED — the GUI's own `KONTROLL_STAGE_PUSHES` env; the running control-plane services; and the
secret-domain roster by NAME with a set/unset badge). It is PURE reads — instance/instance.yml + instance/fleet.yml
+ the GUI env + config/services.yml + the secret-form descriptors — and writes NOTHING, so it never gates
onboarding (the read-only posture of fleet.list_fleet; INVARIANT D*).

This is the SURFACE half (Phase 1). It carries NO secret value (C11 — the secret roster is NAMES + set/unset
only, derived from key presence, never a decrypt) and never reads `docker/.env` (the rendered output holding
decrypted secrets — C11/C12); it reads the INPUTS only. The EDIT/GUARD write controls (mgmt_ip re-IP, tls flip,
fleet removal) are a later, C10-staged phase; this surface stages nothing. Each group degrades INDEPENDENTLY: a
missing/malformed source yields that group's `{"error": ...}` and never blanks the others, and the function never
raises out of the route (service-never-sys.exit — a crash would kill the in-process Flask worker).
