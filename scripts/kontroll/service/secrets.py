"""secret-onboarding domain — guided entry of a SOPS domain's service/infra secrets (the secret analogue of
onboard.py). A PURE plan builder (reads the descriptor + the domain's EXISTING key NAMES — never values) +
an apply step that merges the new values into the domain and re-encrypts it via gitio.sops_write_domain,
returning the path for the route to commit + STAGE (proposed/<run_id>, C10).

Secret values flow through `values` IN MEMORY only — they are NEVER logged, returned, or committed in
plaintext. The plan VIEW exposes field NAMES + which are already set + which will be generated, never a value.
Recipiency stays owned by /.sops.yaml; this module only writes the domain's encrypted contents.
