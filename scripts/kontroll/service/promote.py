"""promote — the capability-neutral propose-then-promote anti-drift gate.

The shared spine of every secondary-capability dialog (telemetry, backup, …): a dialog PROPOSES a plan
(apply:false — a pure read; the diff the operator reviews) and later PROMOTES it (apply:true — the audited
data write). `plan_token` hashes the plan's full write-set at propose time; the dialog echoes the token back
at promote time; `verify_token` re-hashes the CURRENT plan and refuses (a 409) if it has drifted — so a
promote can only land the EXACT bytes the operator was shown.

This is a CONSISTENCY / anti-drift gate, NOT an authorization control (docs/observability-onboarding-flow.md
§8): authorization is `require_token` + the fail-closed audit. The token therefore needs no secret/salt/clock
— it is pure (same parts in, same hex out), which is what makes it testable offline and identical across the
propose and promote requests. If adversarial (unforgeable) properties are ever wanted, key it with the server
`api_token` via HMAC; today an operator on the mgmt VLAN behind the bearer token is the trust model.

Capability-neutral by construction: `plan_token(*parts)` hashes arbitrary text, so telemetry's parts (the
rendered `metrics:` block + the regenerated targets) and backup's parts (the `backup:` mapping + the schedule
spec) flow through the IDENTICAL function — the seam's "promote.py verbatim" guarantee.
