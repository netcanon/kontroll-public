"""fleet domain — the read-only "what have I onboarded?" view (#121).

`list_fleet()` assembles a CLASS-centric inventory of the onboarded fleet: one entry per ENABLED device-class
(instance/fleet.yml) with the capabilities it declares (the module's `metrics:`/`backup:`/`logs:` blocks → the
telemetry/backup/logging dialogs) and the inventory hosts in its group. It is PURE reads — instance/fleet.yml +
modules/<key>/module.yml + instance/inventory/* — and writes nothing, so it never gates onboarding (the same
read-only posture as search/classify; INVARIANT D*).

CLASS-centric, not host-centric, because the capability dialogs are keyed by the device-class `key` (a class
backs up / is scraped / ships logs ONE way), so grouping hosts under their class is what lets the GUI jump
straight from "this is onboarded" to "configure its telemetry/backup/logging". The GUI renders it as the Fleet
panel; the per-class capability badges reuse the SAME openCapabilityDialog(cap, key) the search cards use.
