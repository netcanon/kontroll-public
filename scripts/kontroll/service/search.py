"""search domain — the unified Galaxy + local capability search.

service_search runs the source -> record -> filter -> sort pipeline and RETURNS the
records (no printing); the CLI (galaxy.py cmd_search) renders or JSON-dumps them.

By DEFAULT local hits are SHALLOW (files only, no ansible-doc — sub-second): the cells that
need the deep per-module doc parse read as 'maybe', resolved on demand. `deep=True` (or any
`vector` filter, which needs exact cells) re-probes the keyword-matched candidates deeply. The
I/O calls (local_shallow / deep_probe / galaxy_search) go through their home modules, so tests
patch kontroll.catalog.* / kontroll.probe.deep_probe.

service_search_parity verifies the shallow result against the full deep probe (the accuracy
guarantee: shallow ⊑ deep — a cell only ever softens yes/no to 'maybe', never flips yes↔no).
