"""provenance domain — the read-only fleet INSTALL-PROVENANCE view (MF-5: no verification theatre).

`fleet_provenance()` projects the generated trust sidecar (`ansible/collections/trust.generated.yml`, gen-
requirements.py) + the L2b digest lock (`instance/trust/observed-digests.yml`, the install wrapper) into a
per-collection verification posture, so the operator-facing surface can be HONEST about what was actually checked:
on the current public-Galaxy fleet NO signature is served, so every collection is verified by the `==`/floor pin +
the sha256 checksum ONLY — `unsigned-pinned` (amber). A green "installed" must never imply a signature was checked
(docs/reviews/2026-06-25-never-brick-supply-chain/ MF-5). It writes nothing and never gates onboarding (the same
read-only posture as fleet/search; INVARIANT D*) — and reads NO secret (the sidecar carries names + policy + a
sha256 anchor only; SEC-2).
