"""capability — the capability-NEUTRAL orchestration spine of the secondary-capability dialog seam.

Drives the suggest → propose → promote lifecycle over a `capabilities/<cap>.yml` descriptor with ZERO
`if cap==…` branching anywhere. Two import-by-convention seams, both DERIVED from the drop-in descriptor (the
`requirements.generated.yml` "never hand-maintain the list" rule applied to dispatch — there is no god-map):

  * the SUGGESTER (read-only): `descriptor.suggester.{module, suggest, declared, hint}` resolves the detection
    pair (`suggest_<cap>` / `declared_<cap>`). PURE — a suggester writes nothing and could never gate
    onboarding (INVARIANT D*).
  * the SERVICE (write): `descriptor.service.module` resolves the instance's `build_plan(key, selection)` /
    `apply_plan(plan)`. The instance carries the capability-specific bodies (observe.py for telemetry,
    backup.py at Phase 8); registering a capability adds an instance module, never edits THIS file.

`promote.verify_token` is the verbatim propose→promote anti-drift gate. The route layer
(api/routes/capability.py) owns auth + the fail-closed audit + the scoped commit; this owns dispatch + the
token gate + the write. The "promote.py verbatim, zero spine edit per capability" guarantee IS this module.
