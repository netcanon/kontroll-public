"""onboard domain — the operator's one-shot: collection + host -> a managed device.

Split into the API-ready shape the workstream calls for:
  * build_onboard_plan — PURE (reads only: deep_probe + loaders). Computes the whole
    plan (module + drop-in host blocks, rendered YAML, rel paths, creds-to-set) and
    returns it; no writes, no prints. An error code ("not_installed"/"no_backend") if a
    precondition fails (CLI owns the message).
  * apply_onboard_plan — performs the repo mutations for a plan (idempotent no-clobber
    writes + fleet-enable + SOPS encrypt), prints progress (the exemplar's pattern), and
    returns {"changed","paths"}.
Onboarding a device whose CLASS already exists REUSES the curated module (adds only the host
+ fleet-enable) rather than regenerating a minimal one that would strip its metrics:/backup:/
logs: blocks (#124); the inventory drop-in MERGES so a 2nd device of a class never drops the
1st. A genuinely DIFFERENT class colliding on a key still hard-stops (WriteConflict) unless the
operator deliberately Overwrites.
The commit/push-canonical GATE stays in the CLI wrapper (galaxy.py cmd_onboard), exactly
as the capture-exception exemplar keeps it. enable_in_fleet/_existing_groups live here as
onboard-domain helpers. Credential VALUES flow through creds_to_set in memory only — the
plan display shows var NAMES, never values, and they are never logged.
