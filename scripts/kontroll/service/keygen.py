"""age key-generation domain — the GUI half of the keygen SPLIT (the CLI `kontroll-init` mints the FIRST
control key + GUI_PASSWORD, a bootstrap a running GUI can't do; this mints break-glass / scoped-Semaphore /
control-rotation keys, all of which a GUI that already holds the control key can do).

The security contract is the INVERSE of secrets.py: keygen MINTS a keypair, and the PRIVATE half is the crown
jewel. It is shown to the operator EXACTLY ONCE (the apply result's `private_key`, which the route returns in
that single response) and is NEVER persisted by the service — not to the box, not to the repo — nor logged,
audited, or committed. Only the PUBLIC recipient (`age1…`) is durable: it is added to /.sops.yaml ADDITIVELY,
idempotently, and PARSE-VERIFIED (no existing recipient may be dropped) before the file is written. Minting a
keypair + adding a public recipient are public-key operations needing NO age key, so this fits C10's no-key
posture; the decrypt-needing re-wrap (`sops updatekeys`) is a DEFERRED operator step, never auto-run. Adding a
key role = drop a key-roles/<role>.yml file; no edit here. See key-roles/README.md + SECURITY.md (C11).
