"""identity — the module-IDENTITY reconfigure instance (Phase 4b, #139).

A safe, diff-able change to a device-class's top-level IDENTITY keys (secrets_domain / inventory_group / backend /
role / status) in `modules/<key>/module.yml`. Before 4b these had NO surgical seam — changing one fell off into a
whole-file Overwrite (design `docs/reviews/2026-06-19-gui-paradigm/22-design-reconfigure-overwrite-rework.md`
§5.4, G7). This rides the SAME propose→token→promote→stage spine as the capability reconfigure (Phase 4a): a pure
`current_values` read-back → `_diff.compute_changes` (with the `module-identity` knob_meta that UPGRADES a value
change to the `identity` gate) → a comment-preserving `upsert_top_level_key` write → `verify_no_drop` + the human
type-to-confirm + the C10 two-key promote.

Heaviest-blast reconfigure short of platform settings: changing `inventory_group` RE-HOMES every host of the class
at the one dispatch seam; changing `secrets_domain` ORPHANS its credentials. So each identity change carries
`severity: identity` (the type-to-confirm `reconfig-identity-confirm`), and a proposal may change AT MOST ONE
identity-severity key at a time (so the type-to-confirm value is unambiguous); a `status` flip (severity `modify`)
may ride along. The staged proposal carries `module.yml` only — the operator REGENERATES the scrape/log targets +
re-runs bootstrap/deploy-stack at enact (the identity ripple is named in the enact hint), keeping the blast of a
single GUI action bounded (MVP scope; M6 single-object). PURE propose; the write is the operator-promoted stage.
