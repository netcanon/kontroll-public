"""backup — the BACKUP instance (#2) of the generalized secondary-capability seam.

The empirical proof the seam generalizes: backup registers as a pure drop-in (this module + capabilities/
backup.yml + vectors/backup.yml + gen-backup.py + classify.suggest_backup/declared_backup) touching ZERO spine
file — `promote.py`, `capability.py`, `api/routes/capability.py`, the GUI shell, and the generic INVARIANT D*
pins are all UNCHANGED. The capability-neutral spine dispatches here through the descriptor exactly as it does
to observe.py for telemetry.

Backup reuses the generic shell with no edit by modeling its single role-entrypoint capture as the one
"method" and its knobs as closed allow-list `params` (a preset cron `schedule`, a `retention` window, and a
`destination`) — so the shell's method+param picker renders all three as-is, no template change (#123). The
dialog writes a `backup:` MAPPING block (`{capable, schedule, retention, destination}`) into the class's
module.yml (block_shape: mapping, vs telemetry's list) and regenerates the schedule spec; ENACT is hand-off
strings (gen-backup + configure-semaphore — the API runs neither). `retention` is RECORDED + carried to the
schedule as `kontroll_backup_retention` AND ENFORCED by the retention-prune play in `backup-configs.yml` (#125 — a
destructive git rewrite of the local capture history). `destination: offsite` is OFFERED but REFUSED at propose
(no encryption-at-rest story — captures aren't SOPS; SECURITY.md C8), so `local` is the only enactable target.

DISTINCT from service/backups.py (plural) — that is the read-only VIEWER of the capture git history (the GUI backup
index/view/diff, C14). THIS module is the capability BUILDER that writes the `backup:` block. They share a name root
and the C8/C14 captures concern, nothing else; do not conflate them.
