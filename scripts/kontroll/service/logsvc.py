"""logsvc — the LOGGING instance (#3) of the generalized secondary-capability seam.

Logging is added to an ALREADY-onboarded device class via the standalone capability dialog: choose a method
(syslog_push / journald_remote / rest_pull / file_tail_ssh) + optional params (incl. a retention preset), PROPOSE
(a pure diff), then PROMOTE (the audited data write). This module is the logging-SPECIFIC half — the `logs:` LIST
write into modules/<key>/module.yml + the regen of the generated Vector config drop-ins + the enact-command
builder. The capability-NEUTRAL spine (the dialog/route/promote.plan_token) dispatches here through
capabilities/logging.yml; registering logging touches zero spine file (the seam's whole point — proven by
backup.py/observe.py).

Named `logsvc` NOT `logging` to avoid shadowing the stdlib `logging` module every service file imports. Three
boundaries, identical to observe.py: PROPOSE writes nothing (build_logging_plan is PURE); PROMOTE writes the
DECLARED `logs:` block and REGENERATES the Vector drop-ins FROM it (they can't drift independently — plan_token
gates the declared block, the scoped commit carries block + regenerated config); ENACT is hand-off only
(logging_enact_commands returns the strings the operator runs to make logs flow — a Vector reload + the
device-side wiring play; the API runs NO play).

The module write is comment-PRESERVING line-surgery (shared service/_blockwrite.insert_into_block) so a
hand-written module.yml is never flattened. Param values are validated against the method's CLOSED allow-list
first (shared validate_params — the config-injection guard, defense-in-depth with gen-logging).
