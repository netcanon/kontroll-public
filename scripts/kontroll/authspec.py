"""authspec — F1: derive the onboard form's credential/key fields from PUBLIC backend metadata.

The north-star vision (docs/reviews/2026-06-29-north-star-onboard/10-self-describing-auth.md): a blind user picks a
result from raw search and the onboard form shows the EXACT per-entry credential fields — not today's static 4-field
union (a `network_cli` switch wanting SSH login, a REST device wanting a token). This is the credential slice.

TIER A (this module — Rung 0a): the per-backend `auth:` block in `ansible/backends/<name>/backend.yml` declares the
auth-field SHAPE as DATA (config-as-data-validated, not bespoke branching) — so the right SHAPE is known the instant a
result is picked, install-free and with zero introspection. TIER B (the EXACT per-param fields from a module's
`argument_spec` via `ansible-doc -j` + the auth-param heuristic) is a later rung; `derive_auth` accepts a `deep` flag
for it but TIER B is not built here. When a backend declares no `auth:` block (a brand-new/unclassified device),
`derive_auth` falls through to the generic union with `source="fallback"` so onboarding is NEVER blocked (INVARIANT D*).

The output is an ordered `[CredField]` descriptor list the onboard planner's data-driven loop consumes and the GUI
renders (reusing the existing knob renderer). Credential VALUES never touch this module — it is PURE SCHEMA (names,
kinds, labels), the same no-leak posture as `secret-forms/<domain>.yml`. Each field carries its target `domain` so the
planner's domain-confinement guard (MF-S2) can refuse a field that would cross into another SOPS domain.

TIER B (Rung 3): `auth_fields_from_argspec` reads the connecting module's `argument_spec` via `ansible-doc -j` and
applies the auth-param heuristic (§3) to emit the EXACT credential fields — e.g. proxmox's coherent
`api_host`+`api_user`+`api_token_id`+`api_token_secret` set, not a generic single `api_token` box. Two hardening
gates from the design's adversary pass (docs/reviews/2026-06-29-north-star-onboard/99-synthesis.md):
  * MF-S1 (install-confinement, FAIL-CLOSED): the "TIER-B never introspects an un-installed collection" invariant
    lives INSIDE `auth_fields_from_argspec` (assert `coll in local_installed()` BEFORE any `ansible-doc` call), so
    a future "sharpen a Galaxy result on hover" caller can't bypass it into executing an un-installed collection's
    Python. `ansible-doc` runs collection import-time Python — the trust boundary is the INSTALL, already gated.
  * MF-S6 (mask-ambiguous, FAIL-SAFE): `ansible-doc`'s `no_log` is NOT a complete secret oracle (a module can set
    `no_log` only in code). A genuinely-ambiguous field (no `no_log`, no secret-class name) defaults to
    MASKED/secret — masking a non-secret is harmless; plaintexting a missed secret is a leak.
