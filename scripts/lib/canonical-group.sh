# scripts/lib/canonical-group.sh — provision/verify the C10 canonical's owning group (gid 1001).
#
# WHY this is a shared HOST gesture: the canonical bare repo /srv/kontroll.git is group-gid-1001 (the uid:gid the
# privileged api/onboard-gui write proposals as). To MANAGE those uid-1001-pushed proposal refs — the operator's
# `kontroll-promote` advances main + DELETES the consumed proposed/<run_id> ref — the operator must be a member of
# that group, else the delete fails "Permission denied" (live-caught 2026-06-29 on the .52 baked prod box, F-CANON;
# task_51334deb). ansible/playbooks/local-canonical.yml provisions the named group + the operator's membership on a
# HOST-DIRECT run, but SKIPS them inside the installer container (KONTROLL_IN_CONTAINER=1 — the published-kit and
# local-build launchers both run the deploy in-container) because a container-local group dies with the ephemeral
# installer and the operator name isn't in the container's /etc/passwd. So the HOST gesture lives here, shared by the
# root host-floor installer (install-prereqs.sh — creates it) and the operator launchers (kontroll.sh /
# kontroll-installer.sh — ensure-or-warn). POSIX sh (no bashisms; sourced under sh or bash); every function is
# idempotent. SECURITY.md C10.
