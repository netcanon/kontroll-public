"""scripts/kontroll-discover.py — the PASSIVE-DISCOVERY sweep actor (discovery-inbox Rung 1a, the read spine).

Reaches each already-onboarded device-class that OFFERS a discovery method and reads its OWN lease/neighbour view
read-only, so the un-onboarded hosts on the network can be surfaced into an onboard *inbox*. It writes the
git-ignored `local/discovery-inbox.generated.json`; the GUI reads that artifact through the PURE
`scripts/kontroll/service/discovery.read_inbox()` (which never reaches a device or writes a byte). A human still
onboards + promotes every surfaced host — discovery only pre-fills the existing onboard form (C10 unchanged; there
is NO auto-onboard).

WHY this is a TOP-LEVEL actor (outside `scripts/kontroll/service/`, like `kontroll-autopromoter.py` sits outside
the read-only `_pinned_layer`): the sweep WRITES the cached artifact, and an `open(cache, 'w')` inside a
`service/*.py` module would trip the read-only completeness gate (`tests/unit/_readonly_pins.py`). Keeping the
device-reaching read + the artifact write HERE is exactly what lets `service/discovery.read_inbox` stay provably
read-only — the zero-new-authority proof this feature rests on (design-of-record §"the OUT-OF-BAND cached model").

Passive + read-only by CONSTRUCTION (SECURITY C18):
  * the fetcher is a single hard-wired `http_get` (an HTTP GET), byte-capped at the socket — there is NO
    write/POST/SET/scan primitive, and no CIDR expansion: the sweep reaches ONLY an onboarded device's own address.
    A `tests/validate.sh` `discovery-passive-only` grep-gate keeps a scanning/write transport un-expressible.
  * parse dispatches over the `_PARSERS` table keyed by the descriptor's `parse.shape` NAME — ZERO vendor branch (no
    function knows the word "opnsense"; the vendor-ness is descriptor DATA), the no-bespoke-config tenet.
  * the response is UNTRUSTED DATA: byte-capped at the socket + row-count-capped at parse (flood cap) before it is
    written; every field is re-normalized on the pure READ side (`service/discovery`) before it can reach the GUI.
  * one `write_audit(action="discover", ...)` line per source — the class/method/status/count NAMES only, NEVER a
    credential and NEVER a discovered identifier (C12).

Tier: control-VM / on-demand, NEVER hermetic CI or an install-gating path (it reaches the lab — the BRICK-1
discipline; deliberately absent from `tests/validate.sh` + bootstrap). Its dispatch/parse is proven hermetically via
an injected fake fetcher (`tests/unit/test_discovery.py`). Usage:
  python3 scripts/kontroll-discover.py                       # sweep the enabled fleet's offered discovery methods
  python3 scripts/kontroll-discover.py --class opnsense      # restrict to one class
