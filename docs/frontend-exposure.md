# Frontend exposure — how kontroll serves its web UIs

kontroll is **distributable**: a random operator stands it up with **zero certs/domain of their own**. How
the web frontends (the API now; the GUI/dashboards as they deploy) are served is a **per-instance mode**,
not a product assumption — `instance/instance.yml` `frontend.tls_mode`, resolved by the one dispatch seam
[`scripts/kontroll/frontend.py`](../scripts/kontroll/frontend.py) (covering check
[`tests/unit/test_frontend.py`](../tests/unit/test_frontend.py)). Re-scope rationale + history:
[docs/reviews/2026-06-13-roadmap/03-redesign-frontend-exposure.md](reviews/2026-06-13-roadmap/03-redesign-frontend-exposure.md).

## The three modes

| `frontend.tls_mode` | kontroll serves | Who owns certs/hostname | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`byo_proxy`** | services on **HTTP** (uvicorn `--forwarded-allow-ips=*`) | the operator's reverse proxy (NPM / Traefik / Caddy) | anyone with existing infra |
| **`self_signed`** (default) | services on **HTTPS** from a host-provisioned self-signed cert | nobody external (trust-on-first-use) | offline / no domain — the zero-config floor |
| **`acme`** | services on HTTP behind a bundled **Caddy** ingress doing **Let's Encrypt** | kontroll (operator brings a domain + DNS token) | operator with a domain, no proxy |

An unknown/empty mode resolves to **`self_signed`** (fail-safe — the API is never silently dropped to
plaintext).

## `byo_proxy` (this instance: Nginx Proxy Manager)
Services serve plain HTTP; the operator points their reverse proxy at them and owns TLS + hostnames + any
SSO. kontroll generates no cert and needs no domain. `--forwarded-allow-ips=*` makes uvicorn trust the
proxy's `X-Forwarded-For`, so the API rate-limiter keys off the **real client IP**, not the proxy hop.
Caveat: with a remote proxy, auth creds traverse the mgmt VLAN in cleartext — accepted-risk on a
single-operator mgmt-only VLAN (SECURITY C3), or co-locate the proxy (loopback) / keep self-signed upstream.

## `self_signed` (the zero-config default)
deploy-stack generates a per-service self-signed cert (the API's uvicorn `--ssl-*`). Working HTTPS with
**zero inputs**; the operator imports the cert or accepts the browser warning. IP-friendly (no hostnames
needed), which is why it stays per-service uvicorn rather than Caddy.

## `acme` — bundled Caddy + Let's Encrypt
Set in `instance/instance.yml`:
```yaml
frontend:
  tls_mode: acme
  domain: kontroll.example.com     # services are served at <sub>.<domain> (api., semaphore., home., grafana., prometheus.)
  acme_email: ops@example.com
  dns_provider: cloudflare         # your Caddy DNS-01 provider module name
```
deploy-stack renders [`docker/services/caddy.yaml`](../docker/services/caddy.yaml)'s **Caddyfile** from this
(via `frontend.py render_caddyfile`) and appends `caddy` to the bring-up. Caddy obtains + auto-renews real
certs and reverse-proxies each service (HTTP backends) by hostname.

**Because kontroll is never WAN-exposed** (C3), the easy HTTP-01 challenge (needs a public `:80` inbound) is
unavailable — Caddy uses **DNS-01**, which needs:
1. a **public domain** you control + its DNS managed by a supported provider;
2. the provider's **API token** — stored SOPS-encrypted in `instance/secrets/acme.sops.yml` (a service domain,
   control + break-glass recipients only, **not** the Semaphore key) and rendered into `docker/.env` as
   `KONTROLL_ACME_DNS_TOKEN` (never written into the committed Caddyfile);
3. a **Caddy image carrying that provider's `caddy-dns` module** — the stock `caddy:2` has none; build one
   with [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy) and set `KONTROLL_CADDY_IMAGE` in `docker/.env`.

> **Status: scaffolded + hermetic-tested + compose-validated; NOT live-verified in this lab** (it has no
> public domain / DNS provider, and this instance runs `byo_proxy`). The resolver mapping + Caddyfile
> generation are unit-tested; `caddy.yaml` passes `compose config`. First live operator with a real domain
> verifies issuance end-to-end. Use LE **staging** first (`render_caddyfile(..., staging=True)`) to avoid
> burning the production rate limit while wiring the DNS plugin.

## Adding a service to the Caddy ingress
One entry in `CADDY_BACKENDS` (`scripts/kontroll/frontend.py`): `key: (subdomain, "host:port")`. It is only
fronted when that key is in `stack_services` (the "add an X" test). Services that serve their own TLS (e.g.
onboard-gui) are intentionally not behind Caddy.
