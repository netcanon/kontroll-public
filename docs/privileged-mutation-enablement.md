## 0. The one-paragraph version

The deployed API/GUI is a **network service** — a program that runs all the time, listens on the mgmt IP (`<mgmt-ip>`),
and acts on any request bearing a valid token, with no human at the keyboard. Today it is deployed **read-only**
(no token ⇒ every privileged route 503s; repo mounted `:ro`; no age key) — it physically cannot mutate. Turning
it on means handing an always-on, reachable **deputy** the power to change the source of truth. We do that under
one uniform rule: **the network service may only PROPOSE a change (it pushes a staging ref); a trusted step
(you, or a Semaphore approval task) PROMOTES it to `main`.** And **no decrypting age key** is mounted into the
service. A leaked token can then only *park proposals you can reject* — never rewrite the lab, never read a
secret.

## 1. The three layers (only the first is gated)

The word "actuation" hides three independent things. Propose-then-promote touches **only the first.**

| Layer | What it is | Gated by this decision? |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Provenance** | *Who/what may change the canonical repo* `/srv/kontroll.git` `main`. | **YES — this is the whole decision.** And only for the **network service**; *your* direct pushes from your working tree stay direct (you're the trusted human). |
| **2. Enactment** | *Does a committed config change actually do anything?* No — committing a `metrics:`/`backup:` block actuates nothing; the API runs no play. The enact commands (deploy-stack / fetch-dashboards / `gen-backup`+`configure-semaphore` / prometheus reload) are a separate hand-off **you** run. | **NO — pre-existing, independent gate** (the PROPOSE/ENACT boundary the capability seam already has). Unchanged. |
| **3. Scheduled autonomy** | *Do scheduled jobs need per-run approval?* No — once a backup schedule is in the canonical + registered in Semaphore, it runs **autonomously on its cron, forever, unattended.** | **NO — propose-then-promote does NOT preclude scheduled actions.** The gate is only on how the schedule's *config* entered the repo, never on the schedule *running*. |

So: "does any action ever require human approval?" → **only one: the network service changing the source of
truth.** Your commits, the enact hand-off, and every scheduled job are untouched.

## 2. Why this posture (the eyes-open reasoning)

- **The token is all-or-nothing.** Setting `KONTROLL_API_TOKEN` lights up **every** privileged route on the
  service — including `onboard-apply`, which can write a new module/role + enable it fleet-wide (a HIGH-blast
  write a deploy would run). You cannot enable only the low-blast capability promote; they share one
  fail-closed gate (`api/auth.py`). So the *whole* write surface needs to be made safe — and one uniform rule
  ("the deputy only stages") does that for the low-blast capability writes and the high-blast onboard writes
  alike, with no per-route reasoning.
- **No key, because encrypt-without-decrypt isn't possible with age.** SOPS re-encrypts a file in place on
  `--set`, which requires *decrypt* of the file's data key — so mounting a key to *write* a cred inherently
  grants *decrypt* of that whole domain to the always-on service (1b §4.3). The capability writes carry **no
  creds** (telemetry/backup are data-only), so they need no key at all; onboard's cred-encryption moves to the
  promote step (a trusted runner holding the scoped key does it out-of-band). Net: **zero standing decrypt
  capability in a network service** — 1b's single biggest risk, eliminated.
- **It preserves the human gate you deliberately drew.** The read-only deferral was protecting exactly this:
  no network service writes the truth unreviewed. Propose-then-promote keeps that gate; it just *relocates* it
  from "the route is disabled" to "the route stages, you promote."

The discarded alternative (1a's direct-push + a mounted scoped key) is 1b's ranking #3 — "acceptable floor,
mgmt-VLAN + single-operator only," strictly weaker. We are not taking it.

## 3. The mechanics (what gets built)

Four pieces. All **flag-gated** (`api_privileged: false` default) so the read-only deploy stays the default and
nothing changes until the operator opts in.

1. **Token** — `kontroll_api_token` lives in the `dashboards` SOPS domain (service-secrets; control + break-glass
   recipients only — **not** the Semaphore key, so a Semaphore breach can't read it). `deploy-stack` renders it
   into `docker/.env` (gated) and injects `KONTROLL_API_TOKEN: ${KONTROLL_API_TOKEN:-}` (soft-default) into the
   API/GUI env. Setting it is what *arms* the surface (the `auth.py` 503 gate inverts automatically — no code).
2. **A dedicated push-only clone** — the service gets its own writable clone (`…/api/repo-rw`, uid-1001), with a
   `local` remote → `/srv/kontroll.git`. It is **never** a writable mount of the canonical itself.
3. **Staging-ref push** — when the service runs (`KONTROLL_STAGE_PUSHES=1`, set only in the container env),
   `gitio.commit_and_push` pushes `HEAD:refs/heads/proposed/<run_id>` instead of `main`. The operator's CLI (no
   such env) still pushes `main` directly. The bare repo gets `receive.denyNonFastForwards` +
   `receive.denyDeletes` (recommended **unconditionally** — protects your own pushes too; kills history rewrite).
   **After a staged push the service resets its clone to the canonical `main`** (`git fetch local && git reset
   --hard local/main`) so its read-back ("current") always reflects the source of truth and each proposal is
   **independent** off `main` — never a stack of un-promoted (or rejected) edits that a later promote would carry
   along (F1, dogfood 2026-06-20; `tests/unit/test_staging_isolation.py`). The CLI's `main` push is never reset.
   **The optional `origin` push is the operator CLI's alone.** Under staging, `commit_and_push` does **not** push
   `origin` at all (`and not staging`): the content clone's `origin` is the canonical itself (a `file://` clone),
   so `git push origin HEAD` there would fast-forward `main` — a network-service direct-main write, the exact thing
   this posture forbids (closed 2026-07-05, dogfood VM 144; `tests/unit/test_staging_isolation.py`
   `test_staging_push_origin_never_advances_canonical_main`). A uid-1001 canonical `update` hook
   (`ansible/playbooks/files/canonical-update-hook.sh`) refuses such a push at the canonical as belt-and-braces.
4. **The promote action** — `kontroll promote <run_id>` (CLI verb, operator-run = trusted) fast-forwards
   `main ← proposed/<run_id>` **only if it is a fast-forward** (else it refuses), then deletes the proposal.
   **The in-GUI follow-on is built (item C, 2026-06-15):** the **`promote-proposal`** Semaphore template
   (`config/semaphore/templates/promote-proposal.yml` → `ansible/playbooks/promote.yml`) wraps the same verb,
   driven by a `run_id` survey var. It runs as **gid 1001** against the canonical mounted `:rw` (gated on
   `api_privileged` via `KONTROLL_CANONICAL_MODE`; `core.sharedRepository=group` makes new objects group-writable
   so no host root is needed). The promoter is **Semaphore** (admin-authed, mgmt-VLAN) — **not** the API token,
   so the proposer can never self-promote.

   **The GUI surfaces pending proposals read-only (#129):** a header **"Pending"** panel (`GET /api/pending` →
   `kontroll.service.pending.list_pending`) lists every `proposed/<run_id>` ref + a one-click copy-`run_id`, so the
   operator can feed the `promote-proposal` survey without shelling into the box for `git for-each-ref`. It is a
   pure read of the canonical — it **never promotes** (no Promote control, no `promote_ref`/push import), so the
   two-key split is intact: the GUI proposes and *shows*, Semaphore promotes.

No age key is mounted (deliberately). Onboard-apply's `sops_set` is therefore deferred to the promote step (a
trusted runner with the scoped key encrypts the staged cred *names* into the domain on promotion) — see §5.

## 4. Build plan (commit-sized; CI-green per commit) — ✅ ALL BUILT (live-enable is the operator's, §5)

1. ✅ **`docs` (this file) + `SECURITY.md` C10 + CHANGELOG** — the decision record (`b264be2`).
2. ✅ **The staging-ref push + the `promote` CLI verb + tests** (`a403c1f`) — `gitio.commit_and_push` gains a
   `run_id`; when `KONTROLL_STAGE_PUSHES=1` it pushes `proposed/<run_id>` not `main`; the API onboard/capability/
   capture-exception routes + the GUI capability route thread it; `gitio.promote_ref` + `scripts/kontroll-promote.py`
   are the FF-only promote. Pinned by `tests/unit/test_privmut_staging.py` (stages-not-main, FF-only, refuse-non-FF).
3. ✅ **The flag-gated deploy enablement** — `docker/services/api.yaml` (token + stage env soft-defaults, the
   content-mount writability controlled by clone OWNERSHIP, **no age key**), `docker/services/onboard-gui.yaml`
   (stage env + `user: "1001:1001"` + the `/srv/kontroll.git` mount, mirroring `api.yaml` — keeps its
   host-provisioned age key for device-cred encryption), `ansible/playbooks/deploy-stack.yml` (`api_privileged`
   flag — now tier-wide: gated token render + gated chown-to-uid-1001 + `local` remote on **both** the API clone
   AND the onboard-gui clone, so the GUI capability dialog stages too), `ansible/playbooks/local-canonical.yml`
   (uid-1001 write grant via shared-group+setgid + the **unconditional** `receive.denyNonFastForwards`/`denyDeletes`
   hardening), `docker/semaphore-runner/Dockerfile` (baked git identity). Everything new is gated
   `when: api_privileged` (default off) so the **read-only deploy is provably untouched** (and each clone stays
   root-owned ⇒ uid-1001 can't write it). CI lints; the operator applies + live-verifies on first gated deploy.
4. ✅ **The covering checks** — the privileged routes 503-without-token / 401-200-with are already pinned
   (`tests/integration/test_api_auth.py`); the staged push targets `proposed/*` not `main`
   (`test_privmut_staging.py`); the deployed compose carries **no** age-key mount (`tests/unit/test_privmut_no_key.py`).

## 5. Going live — ✅ DONE (verified live 2026-06-15) + the from-scratch recipe

**Live-verified on the VM 2026-06-15:** the auth gate inverts (no-token 401 / valid 200), the API mounts **no
age key**, a privileged write **stages** `proposed/<run_id>` (never `main`), `kontroll-promote.py`
fast-forwards `main`, and `receive.denyDeletes`/`denyNonFastForwards` are enforced. The token was rotated after
the test. **onboard-gui parity (2026-06-15):** the gated deploy now provisions the onboard-gui clone identically
(uid:gid 1001:1001 + `local` remote + the `/srv/kontroll.git` mount); a `run_id` push from that clone staged
`proposed/<run_id>` with `main` untouched, and `update-ref -d` rejected the proposal cleanly — so the **GUI**
capability-promote path is live too, not just the API. The from-scratch recipe (the lessons folded in):

1. **Token:** on the VM, `sops instance/secrets/dashboards.sops.yml` → add
   `kontroll_api_token: "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"` (a secret — born + encrypted on the VM, never committed/transcripted).
2. **Canonical hardening + write grant** (`local-canonical.yml` does the top dir + deny-non-FF; existing objects
   need the one-time recursive grant): re-run `local-canonical.yml` — its detect-then-fix tasks chown
   `<operator>:1001` and grant `g+w` + dir-setgid **outside `hooks/`**, which stays root-owned `0755` (a gid-1001
   writer must never be able to plant a hook; SECURITY.md C10). Never a blanket `chmod -R g+w` of the canonical.
3. **Gated deploy:** `ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-stack.yml -e '{"stack_services":["api"],"api_privileged":true}'`.
   It renders the token + `KONTROLL_STAGE_PUSHES=1`, clones + chowns the API tree to uid-1001, adds its `local`
   remote, and rebuilds the runner image (the baked git identity). **Live lessons now baked into the artifacts:**
   the API runs **`user: "1001:1001"`** (gid 1001 to write the group-1001 canonical) and **mounts
   `/srv/kontroll.git`** (so the `file://` remote resolves in-container) — both in `api.yaml`; the deploy avoids
   `become_user` (no `acl` dependency) and sets `safe.directory` so the clone task is idempotent.
4. **Promote — the `promote-proposal` Semaphore task (item C):** arm with `api_privileged` incl. `semaphore` in
   `stack_services` (so Semaphore is recreated mounting the canonical `:rw` via `KONTROLL_CANONICAL_MODE=rw`),
   run `python3 scripts/configure-semaphore.py` to register the template, then run **promote-proposal** in the
   Semaphore UI and enter the `run_id`. It fast-forwards `main` as gid-1001 (no host root — the
   `core.sharedRepository=group` + B group-write grant make the proposal refs/objects group-writable). CLI
   fallback: `sudo python3 scripts/kontroll-promote.py <run_id> --repo /srv/kontroll.git`.
5. **Verify:** `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://<mgmt>:8444/audit/log`
   → 200 (no token → 401); a capture-exception/capability promote returns `staged:true target_ref:proposed/<run_id>`
   with `main` unchanged; `sudo docker inspect kontroll-api` shows `/repo` rw + `/srv/kontroll.git` + **no** age key.
   (This instance's frontend mode is `byo_proxy`, so the API serves **HTTP** on `:8444` behind NPM — curl `http://`.)

## 6. What's deferred (named, not silently dropped)

- **Armed containers can write the canonical directly (a container-RCE residual, not a token one).** When armed,
  all three network containers (api, onboard-gui, semaphore) mount `/srv/kontroll.git` `:rw` as gid 1001 — so a
  *code-execution* compromise of any of them can `git update-ref`/rewrite `packed-refs` **directly**, bypassing
  `receive.deny*` + the FF-only gate (those bound the promote *playbook*, not a compromised container). The
  leaked-**token** path stays strictly propose-only (`from_env`+`_push_target` fail-closed coupling; the API never
  calls `promote_ref`). Mounts are gated `:${KONTROLL_CANONICAL_MODE:-ro}` so the **read-only deploy is `:ro`
  everywhere**; this exists only when armed. Accepted, bounded by the reconstructible-cache + age-key-dominance +
  mgmt-VLAN (SECURITY.md C10 residual + accepted-risk row). A future hardening (offsite mirror push / `git fsck`
  integrity check on the canonical) would make a silent rewrite detectable. **Update 2026-07-05:** a uid-1001
  `update` hook on the canonical (`ansible/playbooks/files/canonical-update-hook.sh`, installed by
  `local-canonical.yml`) now refuses a receive-pack **push** to `main`, so the container-RCE-does-a-*push* case is
  caught. The remaining residual is specifically a direct `update-ref`/`packed-refs` rewrite (not a push — the hook
  fires only on receive-pack, the same reason it never blocks a legit `promote_ref` update-ref), which the
  offsite-mirror-fsck check would make detectable. (H2 — converting the deploy mirror to `update-ref` so the hook
  can be unconditional rather than uid-scoped — is a tracked follow-on; not in this change.)
- **Onboard-apply's cred-encryption over HTTP.** With no key in the service, an HTTP onboard that carries creds
  stages the host block + cred *names* only; the encrypt happens at promote by a trusted runner. The
  out-of-band encrypt step is **not built yet** — until it is, HTTP onboard-*with-creds* is incomplete (the
  capability promotes, which carry no creds, are fully functional). This is the honest boundary of the no-key
  posture.
- **onboard-gui is the with-key exception (not no-key).** Unlike the API, `docker/services/onboard-gui.yaml`
  mounts the scoped age key (`SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE`) because the GUI alpha does device-cred encryption inline
  (`gitio.sops_set` needs decrypt-to-add — the same "age can't encrypt-without-decrypt", 1b §4.3). So wiring
  onboard-gui's capability-staging live (this change) adds **bounded, rejectable canonical-write** to a surface
  that **already holds a standing decrypt key**. The no-key property is therefore an **API** property, pinned
  only for `api.yaml` (`tests/unit/test_privmut_no_key.py`). The GUI's standing-decrypt is the dominant residual
  and is **pre-existing** (the device-onboard alpha always held it), bounded by onboard-gui's own fail-closed
  auth + mgmt-VLAN-only. Closing it needs the same deferred out-of-band encrypt step; until then the API is the
  no-key surface and onboard-gui is the with-key one. Tracked in SECURITY.md C10 residual.
- **Rate-limiting as a hard prerequisite.** Already built (`api/ratelimit.py`); 1b treats it as a prerequisite
  for any write-capable surface — it is in place.
- **SSO / token rotation** (C9 residual) — static mgmt-VLAN-only token for v1; SSO is a later cluster.
