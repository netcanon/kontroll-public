# Installing kontroll from scratch on fresh Debian — the "Joe" path

> **Goal (operator directive):** every dependency + every step below is either **(A) AUTOMATED** by a
> script/playbook, or **(B) a SECURITY-BOUNDARY step** completable through **guided / GUI onboarding** (secret
> minting, key generation) — *never* by an agent, *never* committed in plaintext. Joe should reach a working
> instance by running a bootstrap + completing a guided onboarding, with **no hand-editing and no deep ops
> knowledge**. **Live-verified end-to-end 2026-06-15:** a blind install on a clean Debian 13 VM from the release
> bundle stands up the full core+GUI stack following only this doc (14 fresh-node blockers were found + fixed in
> the process — see CHANGELOG). The **[GAP]** tags mark steps that could be further automated/GUI'd.

> ### ⚡ Compose-native quickstart (Phase 1 — host floor = **Docker + git**)
> The install glue now runs in an **ephemeral installer container**, so the host needs only Docker + git — no host
> ansible-core / collections / sops / age (the version skew of which was this doc's fix(install) bug class). The
> rest of this page (§0–§8) is the **legacy host-ansible** path, still valid after `install-prereqs.sh
> --with-host-ansible`. The compose-native flow:
> ```
> sudo bash scripts/install-prereqs.sh                                  # Docker + compose + git + the C10 gid-1001 group

> $EDITOR instance/fleet.yml instance/inventory/hosts.yml instance/instance.yml
> scripts/kontroll-installer.sh check          # deploy-stack --check --diff (the mandated dry-run)
> #   On a node where nothing has ever been applied this is a PARTIAL preview and says so: --check does not

> #   skipped. Everything else is previewed, and it still fails on REAL preconditions you have not met yet
> #   (e.g. the onboard-gui age key) — which is the point of running it before the apply.
> scripts/kontroll-installer.sh                # bootstrap → deploy-stack: local canonical + the stack (§3–§5)

## 0. System dependencies — **[A]** `scripts/install-prereqs.sh` (idempotent; `./bootstrap.sh` shims it)

`sudo bash scripts/install-prereqs.sh` installs all of the below in one idempotent pass. It is
**nixflavor-agnostic**: it auto-detects your package manager (apt/dnf/zypper/pacman) and installs the host
floor accordingly — on apt it uses Docker's deb822 repo (matching the image + deploy-stack), elsewhere it uses
Docker's official cross-distro installer (`get.docker.com`). Everything beyond the floor runs in the installer
container, so only the host *floor* is distro-specific. A fresh control node needs, before anything:

| Package | Why | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `git`, `curl`, `openssl` | clone, health checks, token/cert generation | base |
| `docker-ce` + `docker-compose-plugin` | the whole stack runs in compose | from Docker's apt repo |
| `python3`, `python3-pip`, `python3-venv` | the service layer + generators + galaxy CLI | 3.11–3.14 supported |
| `ansible-core` **(>=2.16 — via pip, NOT apt)** + collections `community.sops`, `community.docker`, `community.general` | the playbooks (deploy-stack, local-canonical, bootstrap) | `install-prereqs.sh` **pip**-installs ansible-core; Debian's apt `ansible` is core **2.14** — too old for `deb822_repository` (needs >=2.15) AND its bundled dist-packages collections shadow the lockfile pins. Collections via `ansible-galaxy` (generated `requirements`). |
| **`sops`** + **`age`** | secrets at rest (SOPS+age) | `install-prereqs.sh` installs both — `age` via apt, `sops` from its pinned GitHub release |
| **`acl`** | ansible `become_user`'s unprivileged-become path needs `setfacl` | **HIT LIVE** — without it, `become_user: 1001` fails `chmod: invalid mode 'A+user:...'`. deploy-stack now AVOIDS `become_user` (root + `safe.directory`), so `acl` is optional — but install it to be safe. |
| `yamllint`, `ansible-lint` | `tests/validate` (the lint gate) | dev only; ansible-lint needs POSIX (won't run on Windows — no `grp`) |
| `gitleaks` | secret-scan (validate + CI) | dev/CI only |
| `prom/prometheus` image | `promtool check config` runs via the image | **no host install** — `docker run --rm --entrypoint promtool ...` |

## 1. Get the code + scaffold YOUR overlay — **[A]**

Clone (`git clone <repo> ~/kontroll`) or install from a release bundle
(`bash scripts/install.sh kontroll-<version>.tar.gz`), then `cd ~/kontroll` and scaffold a
private `instance/` overlay with your own keys — never the tool author's:

> **Choosing the two values:** `--mgmt-ip` is the **static** IP of this node's management interface — the address
> you'll browse the GUI on (`https://<ip>:8443`), so assign it statically first. `--domain` is **cosmetic** under
> the default `self_signed` TLS — pass any placeholder (e.g. `kontroll.lan`) or omit it. Both are editable later
> in `instance/instance.yml`, so a wrong guess is recoverable.

```bash
python3 scripts/kontroll-init.py --fresh --mgmt-ip <your-mgmt-ip> --domain <your-domain> --trust-mode separated
```

> `--trust-mode` is **required** with `--fresh` — kontroll never silently picks your promote posture. `separated`
> (a human promotes each staged proposal — recommended/prod) or `solo` (homelab auto-promote; the auto-promoter
> ships in a later release, so for now it behaves like `separated`). See [trust-mode.md](trust-mode.md).

`--fresh` copies `instance.example/` to `instance/` (your keys only — it never inherits
another instance's recipients), mints your control age key, seeds `instance/.sops.yaml`,
fills `instance/instance.yml`'s `mgmt_ip`/`domain` **and the Homepage portal tiles** (so a
fresh `:3000` shows your real control-plane services — onboard-GUI/Semaphore/Grafana/
Prometheus/API — not the TEST-NET stubs), and mints the bootstrap logins.

> ⚠️ **`--fresh` prints generated passwords (onboard-GUI, Grafana, Semaphore admin) ONCE, then exits — copy the
> whole output to your password manager now.** Your GUI login at §8 is the field printed as **`gui_admin_password`**
> (the onboard-GUI `admin` password). To recover any of them later:
> `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt sops -d instance/secrets/dashboards.sops.yml`.

Then declare your hardware in the overlay **under `instance/`** (not `config/` or `instance.example/`):

- `instance/fleet.yml` — for each "pick ONE" group, keep exactly one module enabled.
- `instance/inventory/hosts.yml` — real mgmt IPs, **or leave the `192.0.2.x` placeholders for now** and add real
  devices later via GUI onboarding (§8); the stack still comes up device-less.

## 2. Keys + all secrets — **[B] SECURITY BOUNDARY → guided onboarding** (the first control key + GUI_PASSWORD are `kontroll-init --fresh`; everything else is the GUI Keys/Secrets dialogs)

> **During install you do almost nothing here — `kontroll-init --fresh` (§1) already minted your control key and
> bootstrap logins.** The break-glass key, the scoped-Semaphore key, and all device/service secrets are entered
> **later, through the GUI** (§8). The ONE thing to do now is generate the fleet SSH key (the bullet below). The
> rest of this section explains *why* the boundary exists — skim it and continue to §3.

These are the steps an agent must NEVER do and that must NOT be committed in plaintext. They are the prime
candidates for a **guided key-gen + secret-entry wizard** (generate-on-box, encrypt-on-box, show-once for the
offline break-glass backup):

- **age keys** (`age-keygen`): the **control-VM key** (`~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`), the **offline break-glass
  key** (shown once, stored offline), and the **scoped Semaphore key** (`~/.config/semaphore/age/keys.txt`,
  recipient of `network`+`proxmox` only). `.sops.yaml` already encodes the per-domain recipiency.
  **[Resolved — the GUI "Keys" dialog]:** the **break-glass**, **scoped-Semaphore**, and **control-rotation**
  keys are now minted through the GUI (`key-roles/<role>.yml` → `/api/keygen`): generate-on-box, the **private
  key shown once** (the operator stores it — the service never persists it), the **public** recipient added to
  `instance/.sops.yaml` additively + parse-verified + staged (C10), and `sops --config instance/.sops.yaml
  updatekeys instance/secrets/*.sops.yml` returned as a deferred step.
  The **first control key + the first `GUI_PASSWORD`** are a CLI **`kontroll-init`** bootstrap (a running GUI
  can't mint the key it needs to run — the keygen split): `python3 scripts/kontroll-init.py` ensures the
  control key, adds its public to `.sops.yaml`, and mints the `dashboards` bootstrap secrets
  (`GUI_PASSWORD`/Grafana/API token, shown once). See SECURITY.md **C11**.
- **SOPS domains** (`instance/secrets/<domain>.sops.yml`) — each VALUE minted by the operator, encrypted on the
  box: `network` (device creds), `proxmox` (read-only API token), `compute` (docker-host SSH), `dashboards`
  (Grafana admin pw, GUI pw, **`kontroll_api_token`** for C10), `semaphore` (DB/admin pw, access-key
  encryption), `snmp_observability` (the SNMPv3 v3 read user). A new domain gets `base_recipients`
  (control+break-glass) via the `.sops.yaml` catch-all.
- **SSH keys** (the fleet/device SSH key, the GitHub deploy key) — generated on the box. **Generate the fleet key
  now** — it is the one prerequisite `kontroll-init` does *not* create, and `configure-semaphore` (§6) **hard-fails
  without it**:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/ansible_ed25519 -N "" -C "kontroll-fleet"
  ```

> **[Resolved — the operator's main ask]:** every secret-minting + key-gen step is now a **GUI onboarding form**
> so Joe enters/generates creds in the browser and the box encrypts them — the agent never sees a value. Device
> creds: `gui/app.py` `/api/onboard` (`--username/--password/--api-token` → SOPS). **Service/infra secrets:** the
> **"Secrets"** dialog (`/api/secrets`, `secret-forms/<domain>.yml`). **age keys:** the **"Keys"** dialog
> (`/api/keygen`, `key-roles/<role>.yml`) for break-glass/Semaphore/rotation. The only step that stays a CLI
> bootstrap is the **first** control key + `GUI_PASSWORD` (`kontroll-init`, item E) — a running GUI can't mint
> the key it needs to run. See SECURITY.md **C11**.

## 3. The local canonical `/srv/kontroll.git` — **[A]** `ansible-playbook playbooks/local-canonical.yml`

Bare repo + HEAD→main + the working tree's `local` remote + the mirror push. Now also (C10): sets
`receive.denyNonFastForwards`/`denyDeletes` + the top-dir group-1001 write grant (setgid 2775).

> **[Resolved]:** the **recursive write-grant on EXISTING objects** (a canonical created before the gid-1001
> grant) is now an **idempotent `local-canonical.yml` task** — it recursively **chowns to `<operator>:1001`** and
> grants group-write + dir-setgid, but only runs the perm fix when something actually lacks it (a second run
> reports `0 changed`). On a *fresh* canonical the setgid handles it; on an existing one the task does. No manual
> `chown -R / chmod -R` step. `hooks/` is pruned from both grants and kept **root:root 0755**: the uid-1001 writer
> that holds the canonical `:rw` must never be able to plant a hook that the next promote runs as root (SECURITY.md C10).
>
> **[Resolved — F-CANON, #119]:** the gap that bit the prod cutover is also closed in the same playbook: on a
> fresh node there was **no named group at gid 1001 and the operator was not a member**, so the operator's Mirror
> push died `Permission denied`. `local-canonical.yml` now **creates the `kontroll` group (gid 1001) and adds the
> operator** before touching the canonical, and the recursive grant sets **owner=operator** — so the operator's
> push succeeds via OWNER perms even on the very first run (a freshly added supplementary group isn't effective
> until the operator's next login). No manual `groupadd / usermod / chown` step. Pinned by
> `tests/unit/test_local_canonical.py`.
>
> **[Resolved — F-CANON, the in-container path, `task_51334deb`]:** `local-canonical.yml` **skips** the group +
> membership tasks when it runs *inside the installer container* (`KONTROLL_IN_CONTAINER=1` — both the published-kit
> and local-build deploys), because a container-local group dies with the ephemeral installer. So a published-kit
> install used to leave the host group unprovisioned and the operator's later **promote** failed `Permission denied`
> deleting the consumed `proposed/<run_id>` ref. Now the **host floor** owns the gesture: `install-prereqs.sh`
> (root) creates the group + adds the operator, and the launchers (`kontroll.sh` / `kontroll-installer.sh`)
> **ensure-or-warn** at run time (auto-provision via sudo if available, else print the exact one-liner loudly).
> Shared, idempotent helper: `scripts/lib/canonical-group.sh`; pinned by
> `tests/unit/test_canonical_group_provisioning.py`. SECURITY.md C10.

## 4. Runner image + collections — **[A]**

`deploy-stack.yml` builds the `kontroll/semaphore` image (ansible + sops + age + baked collections +
flask/fastapi/uvicorn + the **C10 git identity**). Collections derive from `modules/` via `gen-requirements`
(never a hand-listed set). `bootstrap.yml` installs only the enabled device classes' collections + roles.

## 5. Deploy the stack — **[A]** `ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-stack.yml`

Run the **bare** command (from `~/kontroll/ansible`):

```bash
cd ~/kontroll/ansible
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-stack.yml
```

It brings up the **default set — `semaphore` + `homepage`** (the live-usable core). It also **regenerates the
runner's collection lockfile from your enabled modules and builds the runner image itself**, so you do **not**
need to run `bootstrap.yml` first for a basic stand-up. Renders `docker/.env` from SOPS (`no_log`), seeds the
local canonical, brings up the services.

> Add more services later by naming them explicitly, e.g. once their secrets/keys are onboarded:
> `ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-stack.yml -e '{"stack_services":["semaphore","homepage","prometheus","grafana"]}'`.
> The `onboard-gui` GUI + the exporters come up in §7–§8 (they need an age key / device creds first). **Do not**
> pass `-e @/tmp/sv.yml` — that path is an internal GUI-enact artifact, never something you create by hand.

## 6. Semaphore project — **[A]** `python3 scripts/configure-semaphore.py` (run **after** the §5 deploy)

> **Order:** `configure-semaphore.py` talks to the **running** Semaphore API on `${KONTROLL_MGMT_IP}:3001` that
> the §5 deploy-stack just brought up — so it follows §5.

Idempotent: keys, repo (`file:///srv/kontroll.git`), env, inventory, the Semaphore **templates** (including the
**`promote-proposal`** template §7 drives), and the **per-class backup schedules** (generated from each `backup:`
block via `gen-backup.py` → `config/semaphore/schedules.generated.yml`, not a hand-listed hub). For the admin password it
reads `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the env, else **self-decrypts** it from the `semaphore` SOPS domain
(`instance/secrets/semaphore.sops.yml`) with the control node's age key — so on the control node you run it with
**no manual export** (value never printed). To override (or run off-node), export it first:
`export SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt sops --extract
'["semaphore_admin_password"]' -d instance/secrets/semaphore.sops.yml)`. On a brand-new node the `github-deploy`
key and the scoped `SOPS_AGE_KEY` env-secret are skipped (no offsite remote / the scoped Semaphore key is minted
later via the GUI 'Keys' dialog) — re-run this after minting the scoped key to inject it.

## 7. C10 privileged-mutation enablement (live actuation) — **[A] gated**

This is what lets the GUI/API actually **stage** a change (push `proposed/<run_id>`) so a trusted promote can land
it on `main`. Verified live 2026-06-15/18. See [privileged-mutation-enablement.md §5](privileged-mutation-enablement.md)
for the full recipe; the itinerary:

1. **The C10 API token is already minted — nothing to do here.** `kontroll-init --fresh` (§2) generated
   `kontroll_api_token` into the `dashboards` SOPS domain (alongside the GUI/Grafana passwords); the gated deploy
   renders it from there. *(To **rotate** it later, use the GUI "Secrets" form — the `dashboards` domain's
   `kontroll_api_token` field, blank submit re-`generate: hex32`; the value never crosses argv or a temp file.
   Avoid `sops --set` / `openssl rand` in a shell — SECURITY.md C11.)*
2. **[A]** The recursive canonical write-grant (§3 [GAP]) + `acl` (§0, if `become_user` is ever reintroduced).
3. **Provision the onboard-gui age key** — its trust grant (the GUI encrypts onboarded device creds with it; the
   deploy never does this for you, the security boundary):
   ```bash
   sudo install -d -m 0755 /var/lib/kontroll/onboard-gui
   sudo install -m 0600 -o 1001 -g 1001 ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt /var/lib/kontroll/onboard-gui/age.key
   ```
4. **[A] Arm all three privileged surfaces in one deploy:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/kontroll/ansible
   ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-stack.yml \
     -e '{"stack_services":["api","onboard-gui","semaphore"],"api_privileged":true}'
   ```
   This renders the token + `KONTROLL_STAGE_PUSHES=1`, clones+chowns the `api`/`onboard-gui` trees to uid-1001,
   adds each a `local` remote, runs them as `user: "1001:1001"`, and renders `KONTROLL_CANONICAL_MODE=rw` so all
   three mount `/srv/kontroll.git` `:rw`. `api` + `onboard-gui` can then only **PROPOSE** (`proposed/<run_id>`);
   `semaphore` is the one that **promotes** — so all three are named together and **recreated** in this one deploy
   (found live: omitting `semaphore` leaves it mounting the canonical `:ro`). `local-canonical.yml` (§3) set
   `core.sharedRepository=group`, so a promote writes as **gid 1001**, no host root.

**Promote = a SEPARATE Semaphore web app (the two-key safety).** A proposal is landed on `main` from a **different
app, with a different login**, than the GUI that created it — so a leaked API token can only park rejectable
proposals, never rewrite the canonical (SECURITY.md C10). To promote a `run_id`:

1. Open Semaphore at **`https://${KONTROLL_MGMT_IP}:3001`** and log in **`admin` / `semaphore_admin_password`**
   — the §2 value, **not** the GUI's `gui_admin_password` (a deliberately separate credential).
2. Open the **`promote-proposal`** template (registered by §6) → **Run** → in the survey, enter the **`run_id`**
   from the GUI's propose/onboard response → **Run**.
3. It **fast-forward-merges** `proposed/<run_id>` into `main` (FF-only — a proposal can never rewrite history) and
   deletes the proposal. *CLI fallback:* `sudo python3 scripts/kontroll-promote.py <run_id> --repo /srv/kontroll.git`.
   The promote is reachable only by a Semaphore admin on the mgmt VLAN — **never the API token**.

## 8. Use it — onboarding + capabilities (the guided flow)

The GUI came up **and was armed for staging** in §7. Open it at **`https://${KONTROLL_MGMT_IP}:8443`** — accept
the **self-signed cert warning** (the local mgmt cert) — and log in **`admin` / `gui_admin_password`** (the value
kontroll-init showed once in §1; **not** the Semaphore password). Then the guided loop runs in this order:

1. **Onboard a device.** **Search** a collection → **Onboard this** → enter the device IP + creds → **Run** (tick
   *apply*). Behind the form: the creds are SOPS-encrypted, the module + inventory drop-in + fleet-enable are
   written, and the change is **staged** as `proposed/<run_id>` (never `main`). The `run_id` is in the result.
   *(Onboarding a device of a class that already exists **reuses** that class — it adds only the host, #124.)*
2. **(optional) Add a secondary capability.** Click a **telemetry / backup / logging** badge → pick a method →
   **Propose** (a pure plan + an anti-drift token) → **Promote** (also staged as `proposed/<run_id>`).
3. **Promote** each `run_id` in the **Semaphore web app** — the §7 *Promote* walkthrough (`promote-proposal`
   template, the `run_id` survey field). This fast-forwards the proposal onto `main`; for a plain device onboard,
   the device is now in the inventory + fleet.
4. **Enact** ("make it live") splits by privilege (item F): **Tier-1** steps — the Prometheus reload
   (`reload-observability`), a host-agent install (`install-node-exporter`) — are **one-click Semaphore tasks**
   (no host root); **Tier-2** `deploy-stack` (bring up an exporter container / fetch dashboards / rebuild the
   runner) is an **operator command the GUI shows**, because it needs host Docker. After a telemetry enact the
   capability dialog surfaces a **clickable Grafana deep-link** (#122). Nothing gates onboarding (INVARIANT D\*).

> **The GUI promote path** is served by **onboard-gui** (Flask) over the same `gitio` staging mechanism as the
> API — §7's arm provisioned its writable clone identically (`user: "1001:1001"`, the `/srv/kontroll.git` mount,
> chown to uid-1001, a `local` remote) — so a capability-promote from the GUI stages `proposed/<run_id>` (never
> `main`), exactly like the API. The age key + TLS stay host/GUI-provisioned (the security boundary).
> (**Live-verified 2026-06-15/18:** the gated deploy provisioned the clone; a `run_id` push staged
> `proposed/<run_id>` with `main` untouched; the `promote-proposal` task FF-merged it onto `main`.)

## Troubleshooting

### A container build/pull can't resolve DNS (fresh Debian + a locked-down mgmt VLAN)

**Symptom:** during §4/§5 the runner-image build stalls or fails — `ansible-galaxy` collection installs time out, an
image pull reports it "could not resolve host", or container logs show DNS lookup failures — even though the **host**
itself resolves names fine (`getent hosts github.com` works).

**Cause:** on a fresh Debian host, `systemd-resolved` publishes a `127.0.0.53` stub resolver in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
That loopback address is unreachable from inside a container's network namespace, so Docker falls back to its built-in
default of **`8.8.8.8`** for container DNS. A locked-down management VLAN commonly **blocks outbound to public
resolvers**, so containers get no working DNS while the host is unaffected.

**Fix:** point the Docker daemon at a resolver the containers can actually reach (your LAN/mgmt gateway or an internal
resolver), then restart Docker:

```bash
# if /etc/docker/daemon.json already exists, MERGE the "dns" key instead of overwriting the file
echo '{"dns":["<your-lan-resolver-ip>"]}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Replace `<your-lan-resolver-ip>` with your router / internal DNS (e.g. the mgmt-VLAN gateway). This only bites on
networks that block public DNS — on an unrestricted network Docker's default resolves fine, so kontroll does **not**
set this for you (a forced default would override a correct config and could clobber an existing `daemon.json`).
