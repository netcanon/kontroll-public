"""Bearer-token auth for the privileged routes (docs/api-architecture.md §4).

Fail-closed in two senses: if no token is configured (KONTROLL_API_TOKEN unset) every privileged
route is DISABLED (503) — the surface never allows an unauthenticated mutation; and a privileged
mutation that cannot be audited is REFUSED (503) rather than performed silently. A presented token
is compared constant-time (`hmac.compare_digest`); a bad/absent token is a 401 with a best-effort
`auth-denied` audit line (the token itself is never logged). Mirrors the GUI's fail-closed Basic
auth (gui/app.py), extended with Bearer tokens + a per-request run_id.
