"""Ansible filter: decrypt one instance/secrets/<domain>.sops.yml to its dict, or {} if absent/undecryptable.

The generic decrypt-BY-NAME that lets deploy-stack decrypt the UNION of secret_env-referenced domains WITHOUT a
per-domain `vars:` lookup or a hardcoded domain->dict map (it kills `_sops_domains`). The SOPS domain name IS the
file stem, so a NEW credentialed device/exporter needs zero spine edit: it appears in the generated secret-env
manifest, this filter decrypts its file by stem, the render loop composes its env var.

FAIL-SOFT by contract: an un-onboarded domain (the file absent on a fresh node) yields `{}` so its env vars render
EMPTY, never a hard fail (preserves the "a fresh node without proxmox onboarded still deploys" posture). A decrypt
error likewise yields `{}` — never raises. It is applied PER domain (`map('kontroll_sops_domain', secrets_dir)`),
so one absent file never aborts the others (the per-domain fail-soft the union-decrypt requires).

Decrypts via the `sops` binary (the control node's deploy prereq) — version-independent, the same age key +
file-embedded recipients the platform-core `community.sops` lookups use. Runs INSIDE the `no_log: true` `.env`
render task (the value is composed there and nowhere else); the filter returns the dict but NEVER logs/prints it,
so no decrypted value escapes the no_log boundary (C12). Pairs with the `kontroll_render_token` filter (which
str.format-composes the env value from this dict, also fail-soft).
